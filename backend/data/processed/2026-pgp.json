  "document_summary": "The 2026 Pesticide General Permit (PGP) authorizes certain point-source discharges from pesticide applications to U.S. waters (effective Oct 31, 2026\u2013Oct 30, 2031) and sets technology- and water-quality-based limits, monitoring, corrective-action, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements for Applicators and Decision\u2011makers. Decision\u2011makers meeting specified thresholds must submit a timely Notice of Intent (NOI) via EPA\u2019s NPDES eReporting Tool (or a paper waiver), include Pesticide Discharge Management Plans (PDMPs) for large entities, and demonstrate Endangered Species Act eligibility using EPA\u2019s geospatial tool or existing Section 7/10 consultations; Notices of Termination (NOTs) and annual reports follow similar electronic\u2011first filing rules. The permit requires visual and additional monitoring as needed, 24\u2011hour adverse\u2011incident notification to EPA (with 30\u2011day written reports) and spill reporting to the National Response Center, mandates PDMP content and updates, and prescribes corrective\u2011action timelines and retention of records for at least three years. Appendix and Part 9 provisions add extensive state, territorial, and tribal-specific conditions (notably New Mexico antidegradation and Pueblo notice rules and Region 10/Washington species, timing, and littoral\u2011zone restrictions), provide forms/addresses for filings, and list regional EPA contacts and permitted active ingredients or use restrictions.",
