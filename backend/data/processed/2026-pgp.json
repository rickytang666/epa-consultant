  "document_summary": "The document is the EPA\u2019s 2026 Pesticide General Permit (PGP) establishing national NPDES authorization, application forms, and compliance requirements for discharges from pesticide applications (effective Oct 31, 2026\u2013Oct 30, 2031). It defines who must file Notices of Intent (NOI) and Notices of Termination (NOT), electronic reporting via EPA\u2019s NeT (with limited waivers), and specifies PDMP, PDEW, and annual-reporting obligations (large entities and certain small entities), recordkeeping (3\u2011year retention) and visual-monitoring requirements. The permit sets technology- and water-quality-based limits (prohibiting discharges to waters impaired for an active ingredient and limiting Tier 3/ONRW impacts), detailed adverse-incident and spill reporting (24\u2011hour notification and 30\u2011day written reports), and corrective-action/PDMP revision rules. It requires ESA eligibility per Criteria A\u2013G using EPA mapping tools and prescribes consultations, documentation, and special handling for Declared Pest Emergencies. Appendix and Part 9 regional/tribal conditions add state- and tribe-specific requirements (notably New Mexico antidegradation and Pueblo notice rules, and Washington/Region 10 aquatic-use restrictions, timing windows, and signage), plus full contact/mailing addresses and standard permit conditions.",

    "6.0 Corrective Action > 6.2 Corrective Action Deadlines": "Operators must make required changes to Pest Management Measures to correct issues identified in Part 6.1 before the next pesticide application that will cause a discharge, or if that is not practicable, as soon as possible after that application.",
    "6.0 Corrective Action > 6.3 Effect of Corrective Action": "Correcting a condition noted in Part 6.1 does not eliminate liability for the original permit violation, and failure to follow Part 6.2 constitutes an additional permit violation.

[Note: Penalties for Violations of Permit Conditions: EPA and other federal agencies are required to adjust their maximum and minimum statutory civil penalty amounts through rulemaking by January 15 each year to account for inflation. EPA's annual rulemaking adjustments, codified in 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 19.4, are mandated by the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, as amended through the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvement Act of 2015 (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2461 note). As such, the civil penalty amounts below have changed and will likely change in the future due to inflation.
