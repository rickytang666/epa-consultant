## 1.0 Coverage Under This Permit

This permit covers any Operator who meets the eligibility requirements identified in Part 1.1, requirements in Part 9 imposed by applicable states (including territories) or Tribes, and if so required, has submitted a Notice of Intent (NOI) in accordance with Part 1.2.

Note: All Operators with discharges covered by this permit and discharge-related activities that overlap with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) or National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Listed Resources of Concern are required to submit an NOI. See Part 1.1.2.4, Table 1-1, and Appendix I for the information Decision-maker must submit with their NOI and for Endangered Species Act (ESA) eligibility criteria that must be met.

For the purpose of this permit, “Operator” is defined in Appendix A to mean any entity associated with the application of pesticides which results in a discharge to waters of the United States that meets either of the following two criteria: (1) any entity who performs the application of a pesticide or who has day-to-day control of the application (*i.e.*, they are authorized to direct workers to carry out those activities); or (2) any entity with control over the decision to perform pesticide applications including the ability to modify those decisions. Operators identified in (1) above are referred to in this permit as Applicators while Operators identified in (2) are referred to in this permit as Decision-makers. As defined, more than one Operator may be responsible for complying with this permit for any single discharge from the application of pesticides.

For purposes of this permit, all Operators are defined as either an Applicator or a Decision-maker or both an Applicator and a Decision-maker.

When an Operator is both an Applicator and a Decision-maker, the Operator must comply with all applicable requirements imposed on both Applicators and Decision-makers. When the permit references all “Operators,” both Applicators and Decision-makers must comply.

## 1.1 Eligibility

### 1.1.1 Activities Covered

This permit is available to Operators who discharge to waters of the United States from the application of (1) biological pesticides or (2) chemical pesticides that leave a residue (collectively called *pesticides*), when the pesticide application is for one of the following pesticide use patterns:

- a. **Mosquito and Other Flying Insect Pest Control**—to control public health/nuisance and other flying insect pests that develop or are present during a portion of their life cycle in or above standing or flowing water. Public health/nuisance and other flying insect pests in this use category include mosquitoes and black flies.
- b. **Weed and Algae Pest Control**—to control weeds, algae, and pathogens that are pests in water and at water’s edge, including ditches and/or canals.
- c. **Animal Pest Control**—to control animal pests in water and at water’s edge. Animal pests in this use category include fish, lampreys, insects, mollusks, and pathogens.

{4}------------------------------------------------

d. **Forest Canopy Pest Control**—application of a pesticide to a forest canopy to control the population of a pest species (e.g., insect or pathogen) where, to target the pests effectively, a portion of the pesticide unavoidably will be applied over and deposited to water.

### 1.1.2 Limitations on Coverage

#### 1.1.2.1 *Discharges to Water Quality Impaired Waters*

Operators are not eligible for coverage under this permit for any discharges from a pesticide application to waters of the United States if the water is identified as impaired by a substance which either is an active ingredient in that pesticide or is a degradate of such an active ingredient.

For purposes of this permit, impaired waters are those that have been identified by a state, Tribe, or EPA pursuant to Section 303(d) of the CWA as not meeting applicable state or tribal water quality standards. Impaired waters, for the purposes of this permit, consist of both waters with EPA-approved or EPA-established total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) and waters for which EPA has not yet approved or established a TMDL. A list of those waters is available at <https://www.epa.gov/tmdl/>. If a discharge from a pesticide application would not be eligible under this permit because the water is listed as impaired for that specific pesticide, but there is evidence that shows the water is no longer impaired, Operators may submit this information to EPA consistent with Table 1-2 in Part 1.2.3, and request that coverage be allowed under this permit.

#### 1.1.2.2 *Discharges to Waters Designated as Tier 3 for Antidegradation Purposes*

Except for discharges from pesticide applications made to restore or maintain water quality or to protect public health or the environment that either do not degrade water quality or only degrade water quality on a short-term or temporary basis, Operators are not eligible for coverage under this permit for discharges to waters of the United States if the water is designated by a state or Tribe as Tier 3 (Outstanding National Resource Waters) for antidegradation purposes under Title 40 of the *Code of Federal Regulations* (CFR) 131.12(a)(3). A list of Tier 3 waters is available on EPA's website at <https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting>.

#### 1.1.2.3 *Discharges Currently or Previously Covered by Another Permit*

Discharges are not eligible for coverage under this permit if any of the following circumstances apply:

- The discharge is covered by another NPDES permit, or
- The discharge was included in a permit that in the past 5 years has been or is in the process of being denied, terminated, or revoked by EPA (this does not apply to the routine reissuance of permits every 5 years).

#### 1.1.2.4 *Endangered and Threatened Species and Critical Habitat Protection*

Coverage under this permit is available only for discharges to waters of the United States and discharge-related activities that meet one of the ESA eligibility criteria (A through G)

{5}------------------------------------------------

identified below. EPA’s geospatial mapping tool<sup>1</sup> at <https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting-ESA-procedures> must be used to determine whether ESA-listed species and/or designated critical habitat (Listed Resources of Concern) may be exposed to pollutants in the Project Action Area(s) as a result of pesticide applications made to the pest management area(s). The tool will provide a resource list and map identifying whether, where, and which FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern may be present in the Project Action Area.

Activities that meet one of the ESA eligibility criteria (A through G) are not likely to result in any short- or long-term adverse effects to species that are federally-listed as endangered or threatened (“listed”) under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) or habitat that is federally-designated as critical under the ESA (“critical habitat”), except as provided in eligibility Criteria C, D, and, for 60 days, G. Under Criteria C and D, effects to listed species and critical habitat have already been addressed through a separate Section 10 permit, or Section 7(a)(2) consultation. Under Criterion G, effects to listed species and critical habitat have already been addressed through the coordination with the Services.

As one of the provisions in this permit that help limit adverse effects to these resources, the six eligibility criteria (A-G) relate to the impacts a prospective discharger’s activities may have on listed species and critical habitat. Specifically, the conditions in the ESA eligibility criteria relate to potential impacts on Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) Listed Resources of Concern as defined in Appendix A and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Listed Resources of Concern as defined in Appendix A. These are resources that have been identified through consultation with FWS and NMFS on the PGP as having potential exposure to pesticides from discharges and discharge-related activities that warrant the additional protections entailed in compliance with eligibility criteria A-G. Other provisions that protect listed species more broadly include Part 1.6, which requires compliance with any conditions resulting from an ESA Section 7 consultation or ESA Section 10 permit; Part 6.4.3, which requires notification for an adverse incident to threatened or endangered species or critical habitat; and the waiting period between NOI submittal and authorization to discharge, which provides an opportunity for the Services, EPA, and members of the public to identify any potential impacts on listed species and critical habitat, and for EPA to notify the permittee if further conditions or an individual permit are necessary.

A step-by-step guide for determining eligibility with these conditions relating to the protection of FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern is provided in Appendix I, PGP Eligibility Worksheet for Threatened and Endangered

---

<sup>1</sup> If EPA’s geospatial mapping tool is not available, Decision-makers must use IPaC for FWS resource lists and NMFS’ mappers. Links to these tools are available at <https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting-esa-procedures>. If a Decision-maker has a limitation regarding available computer access or computer capability, the Decision-maker may contact EPA or the Services for assistance. Contact information is available at: <https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting-ESA-procedures>.

Species Protection. All Decision-makers are encouraged to use the ESA eligibility worksheet in Appendix I to identify the Project Action Area to be evaluated, document the evaluation, and, if an NOI is required, to help prepare their NOI (if a waiver is approved, to submit the worksheet with the paper NOI). The worksheet guides Decision-makers through the determination of whether they meet one of the six eligibility criteria (A through G) identified below, and includes the following:

- identification of the Project Action Area to be evaluated, which may include areas beyond the pest management area that would be exposed to discharges and discharge-related activities;
- a map with geospatial data of the Project Action Area, including the pest management area, using the EPA's geospatial mapping tool at <https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting-ESA-procedures>;
- list of any FWS Listed Resources of Concerns and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern (generated within 90 days of seeking permit coverage) that overlap with the Project Action Area, using the tools at <https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting-ESA-procedures>;
- supporting documentation required to be provided with the NOI as described below.

To be eligible for coverage under this permit, Decision-makers must meet one of the following six eligibility criteria (A-G) for the entire term of coverage under the permit and, if required to submit an NOI, are required to provide the supporting documentation with the NOI:

**Criterion A.** Pesticide application activities will not result in a point source discharge to one or more waters of the United States or involve discharge-related activities that may expose FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern to pollutants. If this pesticide application is in response to a Declared Pest Emergency Situation, see Criterion G.

*Supporting documentation required with the NOI (if otherwise required) to meet this Criterion - Decision-makers, using the EPA's geospatial mapping tool at <https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting-ESA-procedures>, must provide a map with geospatial data of the Project Action Area(s), including the pest management area(s), and a list of FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern generated within 90 days of NOI submittal that shows that there are no FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern in the Project Action Area.*

**Criterion B.** This Criterion intentionally left blank.

**Criterion C.** Pesticide application activities for which permit coverage is being requested will discharge to one or more waters of the United States and/or involve discharge-related activities that may expose FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern to pollutants, but all “take” of these resources associated with such pesticide application activities has been authorized through FWS’ and/or NMFS’ issuance of a permit under Section 10 of the ESA, and such authorization

{7}------------------------------------------------

addresses the effects of the pesticide discharges to waters of the United States and discharge-related activities on federally-listed species and federally-designated critical habitat based on the list of FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern generated within 90 days of NOI submittal. (The term “take” means to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to attempt to engage in any such conduct. See Section 3 of the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. § 1532(19).)

*Supporting documentation required with the NOI to meet this Criterion - Decision-makers are required to provide any tracking numbers or identifiers associated with the Section 10 permit, the date the Section 10 permit was granted, whether the permit was granted by FWS and/or NMFS, and the field office/regional office(s) granting the permit, the period of coverage provided by the permit, and a statement verifying that the Section 10 permit fully covers the proposed pesticide application activities in the Project Action Area. See Appendix D (NOI form) and Appendix I (worksheet) for the information required under Criterion C.*

**Criterion D.** Pesticide application activities for which permit coverage is being requested will discharge to one or more receiving waters of the United States and/or involve discharge-related activities that may expose FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern to pollutants, but consultation with FWS and/or NMFS under section 7 of the ESA has been concluded for pesticide application activities covered under this permit. Consultations can be either formal or informal and would have occurred only as a result of a separate federal action. The consultation addressed the effects of pesticide discharges to waters of the United States and discharge-related activities on federally-listed threatened or endangered species and federally-designated critical habitat based on the list of FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern generated within 90 days of NOI submittal. The consultation must have resulted in either:

- i. A biological opinion from FWS and/or NMFS finding no jeopardy to federally-listed species and no destruction/adverse modification of federally-designated critical habitat and the Reasonable and Prudent Measures to minimize take have been or are in the process of being implemented in accordance with the biological opinion; or
- ii. Written concurrence from FWS and/or NMFS with a finding that the pesticide discharges to waters of the United States and discharge-related activities are not likely to adversely affect federally-listed species or federally-designated critical habitat.

*Supporting documentation required with the NOI to meet this Criterion - Decision-makers are required to provide any tracking numbers of identifiers associated with the consultation (e.g., IPaC number, ECO number, ECOSphere codes), the Services field office/regional office(s) providing the consultation, any copies of supporting correspondence with FWS and/or NMFS, identification of the federal action agency(ies) involved, the date the consultation was completed, the period of coverage provided by the consultation, and a statement verifying that the consultation fully covers proposed pesticide application activities in the Project*

{8}------------------------------------------------

*Action Area. See Appendix D (NOI form) and Appendix I (worksheet) for the information required under Criterion D.*

**Criterion E.** Pesticide application activities for which permit coverage is being requested in the NOI will discharge to one or more waters of the United States and/or involve discharge-related activities that may expose FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern to pollutants. Such discharges eligible under Criterion E are those where the Decision-maker includes in the NOI written correspondence from FWS and/or NMFS that pesticide application activities performed consistent with appropriate measures will avoid or eliminate the likelihood of any short- or long-term adverse effects to FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern.

*Supporting documentation required with the NOI to meet this Criterion - Decision-makers are required to attach the written supporting correspondence from FWS and/or NMFS and a statement verifying that the coordination fully covers proposed pesticide application activities in the Project Action Area. Eligibility under this criterion is contingent upon the Decision-maker following the measures described in correspondence from FWS and/or NMFS designed to avoid or eliminate the likelihood of any short- or long-term adverse effects. See Appendix D (NOI form) and Appendix I (worksheet) for the information required under Criterion E.*

**Criterion F.** Pesticide application activities for which permit coverage is being requested in the NOI will discharge to one or more waters of the United States and/or involve discharge-related activities that may expose FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern to pollutants. Such discharges eligible under criterion F are those from pesticide application activities that are demonstrated by the Decision-maker as not likely to result in any short- or long-term adverse effects to each FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern identified in the Project Action Area.

*Supporting documentation required with the NOI to meet this Criterion - Decision-makers must provide with their documentation demonstrating the basis for their findings for each individual listed species and designated critical habitat identified in the Project Action Area. See Appendix D (NOI form) and Appendix I (worksheet) for the information required under Criterion F.*

**Criterion G.** Pesticide application activities were, or will be, discharged to one or more waters of the United States in response to a Declared Pest Emergency Situation as defined in Appendix A of the PGP. Prior to any discharge to waters of the United States under Criterion G, Decision-makers must notify and begin to coordinate with FWS and NMFS. Notification shall occur and coordination shall begin as soon as possible after determining that pesticide application is required in response to a Declared Pest Emergency Situation. As part of any coordination, technical assistance or recommendations provided by the Services for avoiding any short- or long-term adverse effects during the emergency should be implemented as prescribed either before or after discharge has begun, as applicable) to be eligible for coverage under the permit. The Decision-makers must provide documentation of the coordination and written

confirmation from FWS and/or NMFS with the NOI. The Decision-maker must also provide EPA with their rationale supporting the determination whether the discharge is likely to result in any short- or long-term adverse effects to FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern, including the description of appropriate measures that have or will be undertaken to avoid or eliminate the likelihood of any short- or long-term adverse effects.

*Supporting documentation required with the NOI to meet this Criterion - Decision-makers are required to provide information on anticipated applications and provide a rationale for each individual listed species or designated critical habitat as to why any short- or long-term adverse effects did not occur and are not expected, and a statement verifying the notification and coordination with FWS and NMFS. The notification must be in the form of an email to FWS and/or NMFS that identifies the appropriate FWS, NMFS and EPA contact(s) and includes a description of the action, a map with geospatial data of the Project Action Area, and a list of FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern identified in the Project Action Area or a list showing no FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern occur in the Project Action Area. See Appendix D (NOI form) and Appendix I (worksheet) for the information required under Criterion G.*

## 1.2 Authorization to Discharge Under This Permit

### 1.2.1 How to Obtain Authorization

The following discharges, consistent with the permit eligibility provisions in Part 1.1, are automatically authorized by this permit beginning October 31, 2026.

- Eligible discharges that result from the application of a pesticide as part of *pesticide research and development* as defined in Appendix A. See Part 1.1.2.4 and Table 1-1 for discharges that require an NOI;
- Eligible discharges for which submission of an NOI is not required. See Parts 1.2.2 and 1.2.3.

To obtain authorization under this permit for all other eligible discharges, a Decision-maker must submit a timely, complete, and accurate NOI consistent with the requirements of Parts 1.2.2 and 1.2.3.

### 1.2.2 Decision-makers Required to Submit an NOI

Any “Decision-maker who is or will be required to submit an NOI” as defined in Appendix A, is identified in Table 1-1.

For calculating annual treatment area totals for purposes of determining if an NOI must be submitted, see the definition for “annual treatment area threshold” in Appendix A.

An NOI provides notice to EPA that a Decision-maker intends to discharge to waters of the United States from pesticide application activities eligible for coverage under this permit. The NOI form included in Appendix D delineates the information required. The NOI must identify the pest management area where the Decision-maker will conduct

If required to submit an NOI, a Decision-maker must submit the NOI once, in accordance with the deadlines in Part 1.2.3, Table 1-2. The Decision-maker must submit an updated NOI if the criteria in Part 1.2.3, Table 1-3 are met. The Decision-maker must prepare and submit the NOI using [EPA's NPDES eReporting Tool \(NeT\)](#) unless NeT is otherwise unavailable, or the Decision-maker has obtained a waiver from the requirement to use NeT for submission of the NOI. See Part 7.8 for detailed electronic reporting requirements. EPA will immediately post on the EPA's website all NOIs received. Late NOIs will be accepted, but authorization to discharge will not be retroactive.

Coverage will be available for the duration of the permit for Decision-makers who file an NOI, including the Decision-makers' employees, contractors, subcontractors, and other agents, for all activities identified on the NOI unless coverage is terminated pursuant to Parts 1.2.5 or 1.3. If a submitted NOI is not timely, accurate, or complete, any employee, contractor, subcontractor or other entity that discharges without the required NOI is not covered by this permit.

Applicators who are not also Decision-makers do not need to submit an NOI.

### 1.2.3 Discharge Authorization Date

Except for discharges identified in Tables 1-1 through 1-3, any Operator with eligible discharges is automatically authorized to discharge under this permit without submission of an NOI. Decision-makers with eligible discharges identified in Tables 1-1 through 1-3 are authorized under this permit consistent with the requirements of this permit.

On the basis of a review of an NOI or other information, EPA may delay authorization to discharge beyond any timeframe identified in Table 1-2. EPA may also require the Operator to undertake additional control measures to meet the limitations in Part 3.0, the ESA eligibility criteria in Part 1.1.2.4, or it may deny coverage under this permit and require submission of an application for an individual NPDES permit, as detailed in Part 1.3.

All Decision-makers with eligible discharges for which an NOI is required are required to submit an NOI consistent with the earliest applicable due date identified in Table 1-2. Decision-makers may submit multiple NOIs with different activities on each of those NOIs such that discharges from different activities are authorized at different times.

<sup>1</sup> State, territory, and tribal specific requirements in addition to the requirements in this table are provided in Part 9.0.

<sup>2</sup> On the basis of a review of an NOI or other information including input from FWS or NMFS, EPA may delay authorization to discharge beyond any timeframe identified in Table 1-2, determine that additional technology-based and/or water quality-based effluent limitations or other limitations or other conditions are necessary, or deny coverage under this permit and require submission of an application for an individual NPDES permit, as detailed in Part 1.3.

<sup>3</sup> Within 30 days after EPA posts on the Internet receipt of a complete and accurate NOI, for those areas with FWS Listed Resources of Concern or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern, FWS and/or NMFS will provide EPA with a determination as to whether it believes the eligibility criterion of “not likely to result in any short- or long-term adverse effects to listed species or designated critical habitat” has been met, could be met with conditions that FWS and/or NMFS identifies, or has not been met. EPA expects to rely on determinations by FWS and/or NMFS in deciding whether to withhold authorization. If FWS and/or NMFS does not provide EPA with such a determination within 30 days of EPA posting on the Internet receipt of a complete and accurate NOI, the discharges will be authorized 30 days after EPA posts on the Internet receipt of a complete NOI. If EPA identifies or includes additional permit conditions or prohibitions based on recommendations by FWS and/or NMFS as necessary to qualify discharges for particular Operators as eligible for coverage under the PGP, those conditions remain in effect for the term of the permit unless otherwise specified by EPA.

<sup>4</sup> In any Declared Pest Emergency Situation in areas with waters of the United States that may expose FWS Listed Resources of Concern or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern to pollutants, FWS and NMFS will have 30 days after submission of an NOI to provide EPA with a determination as to whether it believes the eligibility criteria of “not likely to result in any short- or long-term adverse effects to listed species or designated critical habitat” has been met, could be met with conditions that FWS and/or NMFS identifies, or has not been met. EPA expects to rely on determinations by FWS and/or NMFS in deciding whether to disallow continued permit coverage or if additional conditions are necessary. If FWS and/or NMFS does not provide EPA with a recommendation within 30 days of EPA posting on the Internet receipt of a complete and accurate NOI, authorization for these discharges will continue. If EPA identifies or includes additional permit conditions or prohibitions based on recommendations by FWS and/or NMFS as necessary to qualify discharges for particular Operators as eligible for coverage beyond 60 days under the PGP, those conditions remain in effect for the term of the permit unless otherwise specified by EPA.

{13}------------------------------------------------

<sup>5</sup> EPA may authorize certain discharges in less than 30 days, but no fewer than 10 days, for any discharges authorized under Criteria C, D, or E of Part 1.1.2.4 (for which FWS and/or NMFS has already evaluated the effects of these discharges).

### 1.2.4 Continuation of This Permit

If this permit is not reissued or replaced before the expiration date, it will be administratively continued in accordance with 40 CFR 122.6 and remain in force and effect. If an Operator was authorized to discharge under this permit before the expiration date, any discharges authorized under this permit will automatically remain covered by this permit until the earliest of the following:

{14}------------------------------------------------

- a. A Decision-maker is authorized for coverage under a reissued permit or a replacement of this permit following the effective date of the new permit or the timely and appropriate submittal of a complete NOI under the new permit, if required, and in compliance with the requirements of the NOI;
- b. A Decision-maker submits a Notice of Termination (NOT) and that notice is processed and posted on the Internet consistent with Part 1.2.5.1;
- c. An NPDES individual permit for a discharge resulting from application of a pesticide that would otherwise be covered under this permit is issued or denied;
- d. EPA issues a formal permit decision not to reissue this general permit, at which time EPA will identify a reasonable period for covered dischargers to seek coverage under an alternative NPDES general permit or an NPDES individual permit. Coverage under this permit will cease when coverage under another permit is granted/authorized; or
- e. EPA has informed the Operator that its discharge is no longer covered under this permit.

### 1.2.5 Terminating Coverage

**1.2.5.1 Submitting a Notice of Termination (NOT).** To terminate permit coverage, a Decision-maker who is required to submit an NOI as identified in Part 1.2.2 must submit a complete and accurate Notice of Termination. Information required to be included in an NOT is provided in Appendix E of this permit. Decision-makers required to submit an NOT must prepare and submit that information using EPA's NPDES eReporting Tool (NeT) unless NeT is otherwise unavailable, or EPA waives the electronic submission requirement for an Operator consistent with the requirements in Part 7.8. The authorization to discharge under this permit terminates at 11:59 p.m. of the day that a complete NOT is processed and posted on EPA's website at <https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting>. If a Decision-maker submits an NOT without meeting one or more of the conditions identified in Part 1.2.5.2, the NOT is not valid. Decision-makers are responsible for complying with the terms of this permit until authorization is terminated. If required to submit annual reports pursuant to Part 7, prior to the termination of authorization under this permit, Decision-makers must file an annual report for the portion of the year up through the date of termination. The annual report is due no later than February 15<sup>th</sup> of the following year.

**1.2.5.2 When to Submit an NOT.** A Decision-maker who is required to submit an NOI as identified in Part 1.2.2 must submit the NOT within 30 days after one or more of the following conditions have been met:

- a. A new Decision-maker has taken over responsibility of the pest control activities covered under an existing NOI;
- b. The Decision-maker has ceased all discharges from the application of pesticides for which permit coverage was obtained and does not expect to discharge during the remainder of the permit term for any of the use patterns as identified in Part 1.1.1; or
- c. The Decision-maker has obtained coverage under an NPDES individual permit or an alternative NPDES general permit for all discharges required to be covered by an

{15}------------------------------------------------

NPDES permit, unless coverage was obtained consistent with Part 1.3, in which case coverage under this permit will terminate automatically.

**1.2.5.3 Termination for Operators not Required to Submit an NOI.** Permit coverage is terminated for Operators covered under this permit who are not required to submit an NOI when there is no longer a discharge from the application of pesticides, or the discharges are covered under an NPDES individual permit or alternative NPDES general permit.

## 1.3 Alternative Permits

### 1.3.1 Requirements for Coverage Under an Alternative Permit

In accordance with 40 CFR 122.64 and 124.5, EPA may require Operators to apply for and/or obtain authorization to discharge under either an NPDES individual permit or an alternative NPDES general permit.

If EPA requires an Operator to apply for an NPDES individual permit, EPA will notify the Operator in writing that a permit application is required. Such a notification will include a brief statement of the reasons for the decision and will provide application information. In addition, for Operators whose discharges are authorized under this permit, any notice will set a deadline to file the permit application and will include a statement that on the effective date of the NPDES individual permit, coverage under this general permit will terminate. EPA may grant additional time to submit the application if an Operator submits a request setting forth reasonable grounds for additional time. If the Operator is covered under this permit and fails to submit an NPDES individual permit application as required by EPA, the applicability of this permit to such Operator is terminated at the end of the day specified by EPA as the deadline for application submittal. EPA may take enforcement action for any unpermitted discharge or violation of any permit condition or limitation.

### 1.3.2 Operator Requesting Coverage Under an Alternative Permit

If an Operator does not want to be covered by this general permit but needs permit coverage, the Operator can apply for an NPDES individual permit. In such a case, the Operator must submit an individual permit application in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 122.26(c)(1)(ii), with reasons supporting the request, to EPA at the applicable EPA Regional Office listed in Part 8. The request may be granted by issuance of an NPDES individual permit or authorization of coverage under an alternative NPDES general permit.

When an individual NPDES permit is issued or the Operator is authorized under an alternative NPDES general permit to discharge a pollutant to waters of the United States as a result of a pesticide application, authorization to discharge under this permit is terminated on the effective date of the NPDES individual permit or the date of authorization of coverage under the alternative NPDES general permit.

## 1.4 Severability

Invalidation of a portion of this permit does not render the whole permit invalid. EPA's intent is that the permit will remain in effect to the extent possible; if any part of this

{16}------------------------------------------------

permit is invalidated, the remaining parts of the permit will remain in effect unless EPA issues a written statement indicating otherwise.

## 1.5 Other Federal and State Laws

Operators must comply with all other applicable federal and state (including territorial) laws and regulations that pertain to the application of pesticides. For example, this permit does not negate the requirements under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and its implementing regulations to use registered pesticides consistent with the product's labeling. Operators are advised of their monitoring obligations under FIFRA that, among other things, provide protections for water supplies. In fact, applications in violation of certain FIFRA requirements could also be a violation of the permit and therefore a violation of the CWA (e.g., exceeding label application rates). Additionally, other laws and regulations might apply to certain activities that are also covered under this permit (e.g., United States Coast Guard regulations).

## 1.6 Federally-Listed Endangered and Threatened Species and Designated Critical Habitat

Operators must comply with all conditions and/or requirements that address discharges from activities also covered under this permit resulting from any of the following pre-existing situations:

- a. ESA Section 7 consultation that Operators have completed with FWS and/or NMFS as a result of a separate federal action, and/or
- b. ESA Section 10 permit issued to the Operator by FWS and/or NMFS as a result of a separate federal action.

{17}------------------------------------------------

# 2.0 Technology-Based Effluent Limitations

This Part includes technology-based effluent limitations applicable to all Operators as defined in Appendix A for any discharges authorized under this permit, with compliance required upon beginning such discharge. All Operators are classified as either “Applicators” or “Decision-makers,” as defined in Appendix A, or both. Applicators must perform the tasks identified in Part 2.1 – Applicators’ Responsibilities. Decision-makers must perform the tasks identified in Part 2.2 – Decision-makers’ Responsibilities. There may be instances when a single entity acts as both an Applicator and a Decision-maker.

If an Operator’s discharge of pollutants results from the application of pesticide that is being used solely for the purpose of “pesticide research and development,” as defined in Appendix A, the Operator must use such pesticide consistent with any applicable research plan and experimental use permit.

As stated in Part 1.5, this permit requires all Operators to comply with all other applicable federal or state laws and regulations that pertain to application of pesticides by the Operator.

## 2.1 Applicators’ Responsibilities

To meet the effluent limitations of this permit, all Applicators must implement Part 2.1 to minimize the discharge of pesticides to waters of the United States from the application of pesticides, through the use of Pest Management Measures as defined in Appendix A.

- 2.1.1 To the extent not determined by the Decision-maker, use only the amount of pesticide and frequency of pesticide application necessary to control the target pest, using equipment and application procedures appropriate for this task.

Any Decision-maker who is or will be required to submit an NOI as required in Part 1.2.2 and is a *large entity* as defined in Appendix A must prepare a Pesticide Discharge Management Plan (PDMP) by the time the NOI is filed, with two exceptions (for which a PDMP is not required to be developed):

- Any application is made in response to a Declared Pest Emergency Situation as defined in Appendix A; or
- Any Decision-maker who is required to submit an NOI solely because their application results in a point source discharge to waters of the United States and/or discharge-related activities that may expose FWS Listed Resources of Concern or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern to pollutants.

Decision-makers required to prepare a PDMP must submit the PDMP with their NOI. The PDMP does not contain effluent limitations; the effluent limitations and other limitations are specified in Parts 2 and 3. The PDMP documents how Decision-makers will implement the effluent limitations and other limitations specified in Parts 2 and 3, including the evaluation and selection of Pest Management Measures to meet those effluent limitations in order to minimize discharges. In the PDMP, Decision-makers may incorporate by reference any procedures or plans in other documents that meet the requirements of this permit. If Decision-makers rely upon other documents to comply with the effluent limitations and other limitations specified in this permit, such as a pre-existing pest management plan, the Decision-maker must attach to the PDMP a copy of any portions of any documents that are used to document the implementation of the effluent limitations. A PDMP template is available here: <https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting>.

Operators must review and, as necessary, revise the evaluation and selection of Pest Management Measures consistent with Part 2.1 and 2.2 for the following situations:

- a. An unauthorized release or discharge associated with the application of pesticides (e.g., spill, leak, or discharge not authorized by this or another NPDES permit) occurs;
- b. Operators become aware or EPA concludes that Pest Management Measures are not adequate/sufficient for the discharge to meet the limitations in Part 3;
- c. Any monitoring activities indicate failure to meet applicable technology-based effluent limitations in Part 2;
- d. An inspection or evaluation of activities by an EPA official, or local, state, or tribal entity reveals that modifications to the Pest Management Measures are necessary to meet the effluent limitations in this permit;
- e. Any Operator observes or is otherwise made aware of an adverse incident as defined in Appendix A.

## 6.2 Corrective Action Deadlines

If an Operator determines that changes to Pest Management Measures are necessary to eliminate any situation identified in Part 6.1, such changes must be made before or, if not practicable, as soon as possible after the next pesticide application that results in a discharge.

## 6.3 Effect of Corrective Action

The occurrence of a situation identified in Part 6.1 may constitute a violation of the permit. Correcting any situation identified in Part 6.1 does not absolve Operators of liability for any original violation. However, failure to comply with Part 6.2 constitutes an additional permit violation.

EPA may impose additional requirements and schedules of compliance, including requirements to submit additional information concerning the condition(s) triggering corrective action or schedules and requirements more stringent than specified in this permit. Those requirements and schedules will supersede those of Part 6.1 and 6.2 if such requirements conflict.

at (800) 424-8802 or, in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area, call (202) 267-2675 in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 110, 40 CFR Part 117, and 40 CFR Part 302, as soon as the Operator has knowledge of the release. Contact information must be in locations that are readily accessible and available in the area where the spill, leak, or other unpermitted discharge may occur.

State or local requirements may necessitate also reporting spills or leaks to local emergency response, public health, or drinking water supply agencies.

### 6.5.2 Thirty-Day Spill, Leak, or Other Unpermitted Discharge Documentation

If an Operator becomes aware of a spill, leak, or other unpermitted discharge that triggers the notification in Part 6.5.1 and results in an adverse incident, the Operator must report the incident per the guidelines in Part 6.4.1 and 6.4.2. If the spill, leak, or other unpermitted discharge triggers the notification in Part 6.5.1 but does not result in an adverse incident, the Operator must document and retain the following information within 30 days of becoming aware of the situation:

- a. Information required to be provided in Part 6.5.1;
- b. Summary of corrective action taken or to be taken, including date initiated and date completed or expected to be completed; and
- c. Any measures to prevent recurrence of such a spill or leak or other discharge, including notice of whether PDMP modifications are required as a result of the spill or leak.

## 6.6 Other Corrective Action Documentation

For situations identified in Part 6.1 other than for adverse incidents (addressed in Part 6.4) or reportable spills or leaks (addressed in Part 6.5), Operators must document the situation triggering corrective action and document planned corrective action within 30 days of becoming aware of that situation and retain a copy of this documentation. This documentation must include the following information:

- a. Identification of the condition triggering the need for corrective action review, including any ambient water quality monitoring that assisted in determining that discharges did not meet water quality standards;
- b. Brief description of the situation;
- c. Date the problem was identified;
- d. Brief description of how the problem was identified, how the Operator learned of the situation, and date the Operator learned of the situation;
- e. Summary of corrective action taken or to be taken, including date initiated and date completed or expected to be completed; and
- f. Any measures to prevent reoccurrence of such an incident, including notice of whether PDMP modifications are required as a result of the incident.

{33}------------------------------------------------

# 7.0 Recordkeeping and Annual Reporting

The recordkeeping and annual reporting requirements vary depending on the type of Operator, whether a Decision-maker is a small or large entity, or whether a Decision-maker is required to submit an NOI solely because the discharge overlaps with FWS Listed Resources of Concern or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern as defined in Appendix A. Table 7-1 references applicable requirements for the range of Operators covered under this permit.

{39}------------------------------------------------

## 7.8 Electronic Reporting Requirement

Decision-makers must submit all NOIs, NOTs, and annual reports electronically unless the Decision-maker has received a waiver from the appropriate EPA Regional Office based on one of the following conditions:

- If the Decision-maker is physically located in a geographic area (*i.e.*, zip code or census tract) that is identified as under-served for broadband Internet access in the most recent report from the Federal Communications Commission; or
- If the Decision-maker has limitations regarding available computer access or computer capability.

If a Decision-maker wishes to obtain a waiver from submitting a report electronically, the Decision-maker must submit a request to the appropriate EPA Regional Office. EPA Regional Office contact information can be found in Part 8.2. In that request, the Decision-maker must document which exemption they meet, provide evidence supporting any claims, and supply a copy of the completed NOI form. A waiver may only be considered granted once the Decision-maker receives written confirmation from EPA or its authorized representative.

{40}------------------------------------------------

# 8.0 EPA Contact Information and Mailing Addresses

Decision-makers must submit any NOI, NOT, and annual report, as appropriate, using EPA's NPDES eReporting Tool (NeT) unless NeT is otherwise unavailable or EPA waives the electronic submission requirement for an Operator consistent with the requirements identified on the NOI form in Appendix D, the NOT form in Appendix E, or the annual report form in Appendix G. If NeT is unavailable or the Decision-maker has received a waiver from electronic submission, the Decision-maker must submit these notices to EPA Headquarters at the address specified in Part 8.1.

Within 30 days of becoming aware of an adverse incident, Operators must send all incident reports under Part 6.4 to the appropriate EPA Regional offices (see Part 8.2) for the jurisdiction within which the incident occurred and to the appropriate state or tribal lead agency for pesticide regulation in that jurisdiction (see <http://npic.orst.edu/state1.htm>).

All other written correspondence concerning discharges covered under this permit and directed to EPA, including individual permit applications, must be sent to the address of the appropriate EPA Regional Office listed below in Part 8.2.

Note: If EPA notifies Operators (either directly, by public notice, or by making information available on the Internet) of other reporting options that become available at a later date (e.g., electronic submission), Operators may take advantage of those options in accordance with the instructions provided by EPA to satisfy the reporting requirements of this permit.

# 9.0 Permit Conditions Applicable Within Specific States (including Territories) and Indian Country

The provisions of this Part provide modifications or additions to the applicable conditions of this permit to reflect specific additional conditions required as part of the state (including territory) or Tribal CWA Section 401 certification process, or the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) certification process. The specific additional revisions and requirements only apply to activities in those specific states (including territories), Indian Country, and federal facilities. States (including territories), Indian Country, and federal facilities not included in this Part do not have any modifications or additions to the applicable conditions of this permit. Of the state coastal zone management agencies that responded to EPA's consistency determination, each concurred that the permit would be consistent to the maximum extent practicable with the enforceable policies of that state's program, with the exception of Guam, which included a condition to advise Operators of their monitoring obligations under FIFRA that, among other things, assure protection of water supplies. EPA addressed Guam's comment in Part 1.5 of the permit.

  - ii. Operators must use best management practices (as defined in 314 CMR 3.02) to not apply pesticides to vernal pools (as defined in 314 CMR 4.02). This requirement is intended to comply with the protection of vernal pools in 314 CMR 4.06(1)(d)12.
  - iii. All Operators must control discharges as necessary to meet applicable water quality standards in all surface waters of the Commonwealth, including but not limited to standards for toxic pollutants in 314 CMR 4.05(5)(e).
  - iv. Operators shall stay informed of EPA's and other investigations related to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) resulting from the storage and transportation of pesticides in storage containers (e.g., fluorinated high-density polyethylene (HDPE) containers) (<https://www.epa.gov/pesticides/pfas-packaging>). MassDEP is closely following this issue and understands and supports EPA continuing its investigation and assessment of the potential impacts on human health and the environment. Although the Pesticide General Permit does not require effluent monitoring, to minimize PFAS release, operators should avoid use of containers, such as fluorinated HDPE containers, that have been demonstrated to leach PFAS into materials stored in the containers, and the use of poly-fluorinated propellants.

{44}------------------------------------------------

Operators are also encouraged, where feasible, to minimize the use of formulations containing poly-fluorinated chemicals, either as active or inactive ingredients. This condition is necessary for compliance with the standards for toxic pollutants at 314 CMR 4.05(5)(e).

- b. Pursuant to M.G.L. c. 132B § 10, and 333 CMR 10.00, chemical treatments using restricted use pesticides shall only be performed by an applicator currently certified by the Massachusetts Department of Agriculture (MDAR) Pesticide Program in the appropriate category or categories. Pursuant to M.G.L. c. 132B § 6, and 333 CMR 8.00, pesticides used for treatments must be currently approved for use in the state by the MDAR Pesticide Program and registered by EPA. Chemical application shall be in accordance with the manufacturer's label directions, pesticide use laws, and any conditions imposed by other local or state agencies. Issuance of coverage under this permit does not release the Operator from liability resulting from the negligent or reckless application of chemicals.
- c. Operators must comply with all applicable state laws and regulations, including but not limited to M.G.L. c. 131 § 40, and 310 CMR 10.00 (the Wetlands Protection Act and Regulations); M.G.L. c. 131A and 321 CMR 10.00 (the Massachusetts Endangered Species Act and Regulations); and M.G.L. c. 132B and 333 CMR 2.00-14.00 (the Pesticide Control Act and Regulations). The following general requirements also apply:
  - i. MassDEP may require an Operator under this permit to cease application of chemicals to a body of water at any time if MassDEP determines that the chemical treatment will be ineffective or will result in unreasonable restrictions on current water uses or will produce unnecessary adverse side effects on non-target flora or fauna.
  - ii. Operators must comply with state law and regulations regarding spills and leaks associated with the application of pesticides covered under this permit.

#### *Applicable to Weed and Algae Pest Control Only*

- d. Pursuant to M.G.L. c. 111 § 5E, Operators must submit a BRP WM04 application and obtain approval from DEP prior to application of chemicals authorized under this permit. **Notification to MassDEP must be made through the WM04, as required in the WM04 application.** This requirement shall not apply to employees and agents of MassDEP, Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation, Massachusetts Department of Fish and Game, or the State Reclamation and Mosquito Control Board, or of related federal agencies, while in the conduct of their official duties; nor shall it apply to the use of chemicals in privately owned ponds from which there are no flowing outlets, or to algacides approved by MassDEP and used by legally established water supply agencies to control taste and odors.
- e. Pursuant to M.G.L. c. 111 § 5E, Operators must implement the following conditions for the use of alum:
  - i. In all cases the chemicals added may not cause or contribute to any fish kill, including fish spawning, or other negative aquatic impact.
  - ii. pH and alkalinity: The pH of the pond or lake water must be maintained within a pH range of 6.5 – 8.3 to minimize potential aluminum solubility and toxicity.

{45}------------------------------------------------

During treatment, testing should include, at a minimum, 3 pH profiles throughout the treatment area using a calibrated meter, and measurement intervals should include surface, bottom, and 3 equally spaced measures in between. If, during treatment, the pond has an ambient pH outside this range the applicant should adjust the treatment as needed to attain the pH range. If the final pH after treatment is still not within the range, then water samples from treated and untreated areas should be sampled and analyzed for total aluminum and dissolved aluminum with detection limits of 10 ppb or less.

- iii. Reporting: Any observations of dead, dying or stressed fish or freshwater shellfish (e.g., fish swimming at the surface; mussels gaping) or wildlife during or immediately after the approved treatment shall be reported as quickly as possible to the Massachusetts Environmental Police (MEP) Radio Room at 800- 632-8075. Any pH reading outside the target range of 6.5 – 8.3 should be further investigated and reported to MassDEP. All required water quality monitoring data, fish and wildlife observations and a narrative description of the treatment, including any on-site modifications to the application plan to maintain pH within the desired range shall be included in the report to MassDEP certifying the treatment specifics.
- f. Pursuant to M.G.L. c. 111 § 5E, shoreline areas of a lake or pond must be posted with signs warning the general public of any water use restrictions stated on the chemical label, or otherwise required by MassDEP or other state agencies, for a minimum of one week. This is especially important at bathing beaches and other areas of common access. The signs shall clearly state that the chemical treatment is being conducted pursuant to a permit issued by the EPA and MassDEP. A new sign shall be posted for each treatment event.

#### *Applicable to Mosquito and Other Flying Insect Pest Control only*

- g. Pursuant to M.G.L. c. 132B § 10, 333 CMR 10.00, and M.G.L. c. 252, chemical treatments must be performed by an applicator currently licensed/certified by the MDAR Pesticide Program and in accordance with M.G.L. c. 252 and any provisions or policies instituted by the State Reclamation and Mosquito Control Board.
- h. Pursuant to M.G.L. c. 132B and 333 CMR 14.00, Operators must adhere to the public notification provisions of the Child Protection Act (Chapter 85 of the Acts of 2000) when applicable.

20.6.4.8(A) NMAC [Antidegradation Policy and Implementation Plan] states:

{53}------------------------------------------------

3. No degradation shall be allowed in waters designated by the commission as outstanding national resource waters (ONRWs), except as provided in Subparagraphs (a) through (e) of this paragraph and in Paragraph (4) of this Subsection A.

- a. After providing a minimum 30-day public review and comment period, the commission determines that allowing temporary and short-term degradation of water quality is necessary to accommodate public health or safety activities in the area in which the ONRW is located. Examples of public health or safety activities include but are not limited to replacement or repair of a water or sewer pipeline or a roadway bridge. In making its decision, the commission shall consider whether the activity will interfere with activities implemented to restore or maintain the chemical, physical or biological integrity of the water... In approving the activity, the commission shall require that:
  - i. the degradation shall be limited to the shortest possible time and shall not exceed six months;
  - ii. the degradation shall be minimized and controlled by best management practices or in accordance with permit requirements as appropriate; all practical means of minimizing the duration, magnitude, frequency and cumulative effects of such degradation shall be utilized;
  - iii. the degradation shall not result in water quality lower than necessary to protect any existing use in the ONRW; and
  - iv. the degradation shall not alter the essential character or special use that makes the water an ONRW.
- b. Prior to the commission making a determination, the department or appropriate oversight agency shall provide a written recommendation to the commission. If the commission approves the activity, the department or appropriate oversight agency shall oversee implementation of the activity.
- c.

Statewide Water Quality Management Plan and Continuing Planning Process (WQMP/CPP) The WQMP/CPP states:

#### 3 Antidegradation Review Requirements

The antidegradation review procedure is based on the protection tier assigned to the receiving water, the type of receiving water, existing (i.e., baseline) water quality in the receiving water, the projected impacts, and nature of the proposed discharge. In general, the antidegradation review requirements described in this guidance apply to regulated discharges that have the potential to degrade water quality. These include NPDES point source discharges regulated under Section 402 of the CWA; discharges which result in the placement of dredged or fill material into surface waters regulated under Section 404 of the CWA; and any discharge authorized by federal permits and licenses that are subject to state water quality certification under Section 401 of the CWA.

### 3.5 General NPDES Permits

A number of discharges to surface waters are authorized under general NPDES permits. These include stormwater runoff from municipalities required to comply with the Phase II MS4 stormwater permit, industrial activities covered by the stormwater program (Multi Sector General Permits), stormwater from construction sites one acre or larger (Construction General Permits), pesticide applications in or adjacent to surface waters (Pesticide General Permit), and concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs).

{57}------------------------------------------------

Compliance with the terms and conditions of the general permits is required to maintain authorization to discharge under the general permit. Discharges covered by a general permit that do not comply with general permit conditions or antidegradation requirements will be required to seek coverage under an individual permit.

#### *Overview of the Antidegradation Review for General Permits*

Regulated discharges authorized by general permits are not required to undergo a Tier 2 antidegradation review as part of the permitting process. However, new and reissued general permits must be evaluated to consider the potential for significant degradation as a result of the permitted discharges.

Discharges that comply with general permits are not likely to cause significant degradation of water quality. In addition, activities covered under general permits (e.g., construction, industries, municipalities, dairies, feedlots, etc.) are considered to have social and economic importance to New Mexico. Therefore, antidegradation review for general permits will be based on whether or not the permit conditions are met and if the BMPs are effective at limiting (or eliminating) pollutant loading to minimize water quality impacts.

EPA Region 6's Procedures for Implementing NPDES Permits in New Mexico (NMIP) The NMIP states:

### III. Antidegradation Implementation Between Federal and State Policies

#### A. General

The Antidegradation Policy and Implementation Plan section of the NMWQS sets forth the requirements to protect designated uses through implementation of the State water quality standards. Furthermore, the policy sets forth the intent to protect the existing quality of those waters, whose quality exceeds their designated use. The limitations and monitoring requirements set forth in a proposed permit must be protective of the State water quality standards and designated uses. Permit requirements must be protective of the assimilative capacity of the receiving waters, which are protective of the designated uses of that water.

## **Condition #3: Protection of Surface Waters Other Than Outstanding Natural Resource Waters**

*EPA shall include the following condition in Part 9 of the Final PGP to reasonably ensure that the permitted pesticide discharge activities to surface waters other than ONRWs will be conducted in a manner that will comply with applicable State water quality standards, including the antidegradation policy (20.6.4.8(A)), and statewide water quality management plan:*

- c. Prior to pesticide application discharge to surface waters other than ONRWs for restoration or maintenance activities that may result in temporary and

{58}------------------------------------------------

short-term degradation, Operators shall submit a copy of the Notice of Intent (NOI), project plan, and Notice of Termination (NOT) to the NMED for review. NMED, or the appropriate oversight agency, will review on a case-by-case basis discharges that may result in temporary and short-term degradation from restoration or maintenance activities. In the NOI and project plan, Operators must demonstrate that the degradation from restoration or maintenance activities (1) will be limited to the shortest possible time; (2) will be minimized and controlled by best management practices or in accordance with permit requirements as appropriate, and all practical means of minimizing the duration, magnitude, frequency and cumulative effects of such degradation shall be utilized; and (3) will not result in water quality lower than necessary to protect any existing use of the surface water. Discharges that will not comply with these antidegradation requirements will be required to seek coverage under an individual permit.

All requested material should be sent to:

### *Regulatory Citations and Guidance*

20.6.2.1201 NMAC [Notice of Intent to Discharge] states:

- A. Except for the notices specified in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, any person intending to make a new water contaminant discharge or to alter the character or location of an existing water contaminant discharge, unless the discharge is being made or will be made into a community sewer system or subject to the Liquid Waste Disposal Regulations adopted by the New Mexico environmental improvement board, shall file a notice with the ground water quality bureau of the department for discharges that may affect ground water, and/or the surface water quality bureau of the department for discharges that may affect surface water.
- C. Notices shall state:
  - (1) the name of the person making the discharge;
  - (2) the address of the person making the discharge;
  - (3) the location of the discharge;
  - (4) an estimate of the concentration of water contaminants in the discharge; and

{59}------------------------------------------------

(5) the quantity of the discharge.

20.6.4.8(A) NMAC [Antidegradation Policy and Implementation Plan] states:

(4) This antidegradation policy does not prohibit activities that may result in degradation in surface waters of the state when such activities will result in restoration or maintenance of the chemical, physical or biological integrity of the water.

(b) For surface waters of the state other than ONRWs, the department shall review on a case-by-case basis discharges that may result in degradation from restoration or maintenance activities, and may approve such activities in accordance with the following:

(i) the degradation shall be limited to the shortest possible time;

(ii) the degradation shall be minimized and controlled by best management practices or in accordance with permit requirements as appropriate, and all practical means of minimizing the duration, magnitude, frequency and cumulative effects of such degradation shall be utilized; and

(iii) the degradation shall not result in water quality lower than necessary to protect any existing use of the surface water.

20.6.4.13 NMAC [General Criteria] states:

F. Toxic Pollutants: (1) Except as provided in 20.6.4.16 NMAC, surface waters of the state shall be free of toxic pollutants from other than natural causes in amounts, concentrations or combinations that affect the propagation of fish or that are toxic to humans, livestock or other animals, fish or other aquatic organisms, wildlife using aquatic environments for habitation or aquatic organisms for food, or that will or can reasonably be expected to bioaccumulate in tissues of fish, shellfish and other aquatic organisms to levels that will impair the health of aquatic organisms or wildlife or result in unacceptable tastes, odors or health risks to human consumers of aquatic organisms...

Statewide Water Quality Management Plan and Continuing Planning Process (WQMP/CPP)

The WQMP/CPP states:

#### 3 Antidegradation Review Requirements

The antidegradation review procedure is based on the protection tier assigned to the receiving water, the type of receiving water, existing (i.e., baseline) water quality in the receiving water, the projected impacts, and nature of the proposed discharge. In general, the antidegradation review requirements described in this guidance apply to regulated discharges that have the potential to degrade water quality. These include NPDES point source discharges regulated under Section 402 of the CWA; discharges which result in the placement of dredged or fill material into surface waters regulated under Section 404 of the CWA; and any

{60}------------------------------------------------

discharge authorized by federal permits and licenses that are subject to state water quality certification under Section 401 of the CWA.

### 3.5 General NPDES Permits

A number of discharges to surface waters are authorized under general NPDES permits. These include stormwater runoff from municipalities required to comply with the Phase II MS4 stormwater permit, industrial activities covered by the stormwater program (Multi Sector General Permits), stormwater from construction sites one acre or larger (Construction General Permits), pesticide applications in or adjacent to surface waters (Pesticide General Permit), and concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs).

Compliance with the terms and conditions of the general permits is required to maintain authorization to discharge under the general permit. Discharges covered by a general permit that do not comply with general permit conditions or antidegradation requirements will be required to seek coverage under an individual permit.

#### *Overview of the Antidegradation Review for General Permits*

Regulated discharges authorized by general permits are not required to undergo a Tier 2 antidegradation review as part of the permitting process. However, new and reissued general permits must be evaluated to consider the potential for significant degradation as a result of the permitted discharges.

Discharges that comply with general permits are not likely to cause significant degradation of water quality. In addition, activities covered under general permits (e.g., construction, industries, municipalities, dairies, feedlots, etc.) are considered to have social and economic importance to New Mexico. Therefore, antidegradation review for general permits will be based on whether or not the permit conditions are met and if the BMPs are effective at limiting (or eliminating) pollutant loading to minimize water quality impacts.

### *Regulatory Citations and Guidance*

20.6.2.1203 [Notification of Discharge Removal] states:

A. With respect to any discharge from any facility of oil or other water contaminant, in such quantity as may with reasonable probability injure or be detrimental to human health, animal or plant life, or property, or unreasonably interfere with the public welfare or the use of property, the following notifications and corrective actions are required:

(1) As soon as possible after learning of such a discharge, but in no event more than twenty-four (24) hours thereafter, any person in charge of the facility shall orally notify the chief of the ground water quality bureau of the department, or the appropriate counterpart in any constituent agency delegated responsibility for enforcement of these rules as to any facility subject to such delegation. To the best of that person's knowledge, the following items of information shall be provided:

(a) the name, address, and telephone number of the person or persons in charge of the facility, as well as of the owner and/or operator of the facility;

(b) the name and address of the facility;

(c) the date, time, location, and duration of the discharge;

(d) the source and cause of discharge;

(e) a description of the discharge, including its chemical composition;

(f) the estimated volume of the discharge; and

(g) any actions taken to mitigate immediate damage from the discharge.

{64}------------------------------------------------

- (2) When in doubt as to which agency to notify, the person in charge of the facility shall notify the chief of the ground water quality bureau of the department. If that department does not have authority pursuant to commission delegation, the department shall notify the appropriate constituent agency.
- (3) Within one week after the discharger has learned of the discharge, the facility owner and/or operator shall send written notification to the same department official, verifying the prior oral notification as to each of the foregoing items and providing any appropriate additions or corrections to the information contained in the prior oral notification.
- (4) The oral and written notification and reporting requirements contained in this Subsection A are not intended to be duplicative of discharge notification and reporting requirements promulgated by the oil conservation commission (OCC) or by the oil conservation division (OCD); therefore, any facility which is subject to OCC or OCD discharge notification and reporting requirements need not additionally comply with the notification and reporting requirements herein.
- (5) As soon as possible after learning of such a discharge, the owner/operator of the facility shall take such corrective actions as are necessary or appropriate to contain and remove or mitigate the damage caused by the discharge.
- (6) If it is possible to do so without unduly delaying needed corrective actions, the facility owner/operator shall endeavor to contact and consult with the chief of the ground water quality bureau of the department or appropriate counterpart in a delegated agency, in an effort to determine the department's views as to what further corrective actions may be necessary or appropriate to the discharge in question. In any event, no later than fifteen days after the discharger learns of the discharge, the facility owner/operator shall send to said Bureau Chief a written report describing any corrective actions taken and/or to be taken relative to the discharge. Upon a written request and for good cause shown, the bureau chief may extend the time limit beyond fifteen (15) days.
- (7) The bureau chief shall approve or disapprove in writing the foregoing corrective action report within thirty (30) days of its receipt by the department. In the event that the report is not satisfactory to the department, the bureau chief shall specify in writing to the facility owner/operator any shortcomings in the report or in the corrective actions already taken or proposed to be taken relative to the discharge, and shall give the facility owner/operator a reasonable and clearly specified time within which to submit a modified corrective action report. The bureau chief shall approve or disapprove in writing the modified corrective action report within fifteen (15) days of its receipt by the department.
- (8) In the event that the modified corrective action report also is unsatisfactory to the department, the facility owner/operator has five (5) days from the notification by the

{65}------------------------------------------------

bureau chief that it is unsatisfactory to appeal to the department secretary. The department secretary shall approve or disapprove the modified corrective action report within five (5) days of receipt of the appeal from the bureau chief's decision. In the absence of either corrective action consistent with the approved corrective action report or with the decision of the secretary concerning the shortcomings of the modified corrective action report, the department may take whatever enforcement or legal action it deems necessary or appropriate.

- (9) If the secretary determines that the discharge causes or may with reasonable probability cause water pollution in excess of the standards and requirements of Section 20.6.2.4103 NMAC, and the water pollution will not be abated within one hundred and eighty (180) days after notice is required to be given pursuant to Paragraph (1) of Subsection A of Section 20.6.2.1203 NMAC, the secretary may notify the facility owner/operator that he is a responsible person and that an abatement plan may be required pursuant to Section 20.6.2.4104 and Subsection A of Section 20.6.2.4106 NMAC.
- B. Exempt from the requirements of this section are continuous or periodic discharges which are made:
  - (1) in conformance with regulations of the commission and rules, regulations or orders of other state or federal agencies; or
  - (2) in violation of regulations of the commission, but pursuant to an assurance of discontinuance or schedule of compliance approved by the commission or one of its duly authorized constituent agencies.
- C. As used in this section and in Sections 20.6.2.4100 through 20.6.2.4115 NMAC, but not in other sections of this part:
  - (1) “discharge” means spilling, leaking, pumping, pouring, emitting, emptying, or dumping into water or in a location and manner where there is a reasonable probability that the discharged substance will reach surface or subsurface water;
  - (2) “facility” means any structure, installation, operation, storage tank, transmission line, motor vehicle, rolling stock, or activity of any kind, whether stationary or mobile;
  - (3) “oil” means oil of any kind or in any form including petroleum, fuel oil, sludge, oil refuse and oil mixed with wastes;
  - (4) “operator” means the person or persons responsible for the overall operations of a facility; and
  - (5) “owner” means the person or persons who own a facility, or part of a facility.
- D. Notification of discharge received pursuant to this part or information obtained by the exploitation of such notification shall not be used against any such person in any criminal case, except for perjury or for giving a false statement.

{66}------------------------------------------------

E. Any person who has any information relating to any discharge from any facility of oil or other water contaminant, in such quantity as may with reasonable probability injure or be detrimental to human health, animal or plant life, or property, or unreasonably interfere with the public welfare or the use of property, is urged to notify the chief of the ground water quality bureau of the department. Upon such notification, the secretary may require an owner/operator or a responsible person to perform corrective actions pursuant to Paragraphs (5) and (9) of Subsection A of Section 20.6.2.1203 NMAC.

2. The Project proponent is authorized to apply herbicides to no more than 40 percent of native vegetation on shorelines, roadsides and ditches, but is authorized to apply herbicide to 100 percent of any noxious or quarantine-listed weeds.

Note: Ecology recognizes that discharge permits can regulate the specific areas where a Project proponent discharges (or intentionally applies) a chemical. A discharge permit cannot regulate or control the extent of dispersion because it varies depending on environmental conditions. Dispersion means that sometimes the treatment affects more area or less area than anticipated.

##### d) Conditions for Algae Control

1. The Project proponent may intentionally apply algaecides to filamentous green algae provided the treated areas do not exceed the maximum amount of littoral zone allowed according to the waterbody's size.
2. The Project proponent may intentionally apply algaecides to the entire waterbody or sections of the waterbody, as needed, when cyanobacteria or other potentially toxic or environmentally harmful algae species are in the waterbody.
3. Restrictions for algaecide treatments are as follows:
4. If a Project proponent must conduct a full-waterbody pesticide (or algaecide) treatment for algae:
  - i. Project proponents must take at minimum one dissolved oxygen measurement approximately 24 hours prior to the planned algae treatment. Multiple dissolved oxygen measurements may be taken at the same time of day as the planned treatment to determine an average dissolved oxygen level for the waterbody.
  - ii. Project proponents must measure dissolved oxygen after the algaecide treatment is complete and the after effects of the treatment are occurring. The post-treatment dissolved oxygen level must not be lower than 0.2 mg/L below the mandatory single pre-treatment measurement or the average of multiple pre-treatment measurements.

{91}------------------------------------------------

e) If water quality or algae conditions are such that a Project proponent believes a full-waterbody treatment may cause a lethal drop in dissolved oxygen, or the Project proponent is unable to conduct pre-treatment dissolved oxygen monitoring, the Project proponent may use the following alternative treatment methods:

1. The Project proponent may use only phosphorous sequestration products in the algae treatment.
2. The Project proponent may treat up to one third of the lake each week with algacide.
  - Justification: Restrictions on the active ingredients allowed, as well as when and how pesticide products may be applied are technology-based requirements which Ecology has determined are necessary to meet the state requirement for the use of all known, available and reasonable methods of prevention, control and treatment (AKART) and water quality standards.

{99}------------------------------------------------

#### 17. Conditions for Water Rights and Providing Replacement Water

a) Ecology includes notification of treatments and requirements for replacement water for individuals who withdraw potable water or that have a valid water right or claim for irrigation water or livestock in the pesticide permits it issues.

Project proponents are required to provide, as detailed below, an alternative or replacement water source when treatment will affect potable water, irrigation water, or livestock watering, uses in order to comply with water rights laws and regulations.

- 1) Information about existing water rights is available using the database linked on the following webpage. Project proponents may also contact Ecology regional staff listed on the webpage for assistance <https://ecology.wa.gov/Regulations-Permits/Guidance-technical-assistance/Water-rights-search>.
- 2) The Project proponents must notify individuals who withdraw potable water, or that have a valid water right or claim for irrigation water or livestock watering prior to treatment with any chemical that restricts the use of the water for these purposes.
- 3) Notification must be made to all those with a valid water claim or right in the treatment area, as well as in any applicable setback distances on the product label from the edge of the treatment area whose water use may be affected by the pending treatment.
  - i. Initial notification must occur prior any chemical treatment occurring during the year, and must occur each year treatment takes place.

b) If requested by an affected water user, the Project proponents must provide at least two weeks advance notice of pending treatments with potable water, irrigation water, or livestock watering, restrictions. If requested by an affected water user(s), the Project proponents, at their own expense, must provide a replacement/alternative water supply until the water at the point of withdrawal tests at or below the concentration specified for the active ingredient(s) on the product label for the restricted water use. The replacement/alternative water supply must allow the requestor to use water as they are accustomed to (e.g. be able to run their kitchen faucet and obtain potable water), however the requestor may agree to lesser water provision (e.g. bottled water for a vacation house) if they choose.

- 1) Project proponents are responsible for reaching an agreement with the requestor (affected water user) to determine how the replacement/alternative water supply will be provided.
  - Justification: These requirements are intended to protect the public health, welfare, and enjoyment of waters of the state by reducing the public's

{100}------------------------------------------------

exposure to pesticides and preventing the improper discharge of pesticides.

## Appendix ADefinitions, Abbreviations, and Acronyms

### A.1. Definitions

**Action Area** – all areas to be affected directly or indirectly by the Federal action (i.e., the PGP) and not merely the immediate area involved in the action. (See 50 CFR 402.02).

**Action Threshold** – the point at which pest populations or environmental conditions necessitate that pest control action be taken based on economic, human health, aesthetic, or other effects. An action threshold may be based on current and/or past environmental factors that are or have been demonstrated to be conducive to pest emergence and/or growth, as well as past and/or current pest presence. Action thresholds are those conditions that indicate both the need for control actions and the proper timing of such actions.

**Active Ingredient** – any substance (or group of structurally similar substances if specified by the Agency) that will prevent, destroy, repel or mitigate any pest, or that functions as a plant regulator, desiccant, or defoliant within the meaning of FIFRA sec. 2(a). [40 CFR 152.3] Active ingredient also means a pesticidal substance that is intended to be produced and used in a living plant, or in the produce thereof, and the genetic material necessary for the production of such a pesticidal substance. [40 CFR 174.3]

**Adverse Incident** – means an unusual or unexpected incident that an Operator has observed upon inspection or of which the Operator otherwise become aware, in which:

- (1) There is evidence that a person or non-target organism has likely been exposed to a pesticide residue, and
- (2) The person or non-target organism suffered a toxic or adverse effect.

The phrase toxic or adverse effect includes effects that occur as a result of a discharge to waters of the United States on non-target plants, fish, or wildlife that are unusual or unexpected (e.g., effects are to organisms not otherwise described on the pesticide product label or otherwise not expected to be present) as a result of exposure to a pesticide residue, and may include:

- Distressed or dead juvenile and small fishes
- Washed up or floating fish
- Fish swimming abnormally or erratically
- Fish lying lethargically at water surface or in shallow water
- Fish that are listless or nonresponsive to disturbance
- Stunting, wilting, or desiccation of non-target submerged or emergent aquatic plants
- Other dead or visibly distressed non-target aquatic organisms (amphibians, turtles, invertebrates, *etc.*)

The phrase, toxic or adverse effect, also includes any adverse effects to humans (e.g., skin rashes) or domesticated animals that occur either from direct contact with or as a secondary effect from a discharge (e.g., sickness from consumption of plants or animals exposed to

{107}------------------------------------------------

pesticides) to waters of the United States that are temporally and spatially related to exposure to a pesticide residue (e.g., vomiting, lethargy).

**Annual Treatment Area Threshold** – an area (in acres) or linear distance (in miles) in a calendar year to which a Decision-maker is authorizing and/or performing pesticide applications in that area for activities covered under this permit.

For calculating annual treatment areas for Mosquitoes and Other Flying Insect Pest Control and Forest Canopy Pest for comparing with any threshold in Table 1-1, count each pesticide application activity to a treatment area (*i.e.*, that area where a pesticide application is intended to provide pesticidal benefits within the pest management area) as a separate area treated. For example, applying pesticides three times a year to the same 3,000 acre site should be counted as 9,000 acres of treatment area for purposes of determining if such an application exceeds an annual treatment area threshold. The treatment area for these two pesticide use patterns is additive over the calendar year.

For calculating annual treatment areas for Weed and Algae Control and Animal Pest Control for comparing with any threshold in Table 1-1, calculations should include either the linear extent of or the surface area of waters for applications made to waters of the United States or at water's edge adjacent to waters of the United States. For calculating the annual treatment area, count each treatment area only once, regardless of the number of pesticide application activities performed on that area in a given year. Also, for linear features (e.g., a canal or ditch), use the length of the linear feature whether treating in or adjacent to the feature, regardless of the number of applications made to that feature during the calendar year. For example, whether treating the bank on one side of a ten-mile long ditch, banks on both sides of the ditch, and/or water in that ditch, the total treatment area is ten miles for purposes of determining if an NOI is required to be submitted. Additionally, if the same 10 miles area is treated more than once in a calendar year, the total area treated is still 10 miles for purposes of comparing with any threshold in Table 1-1. The treatment area for these two pesticide use patterns is not additive over the calendar year.

**Applicator** – any entity who performs the application of a pesticide or who has day-to-day control of the application (*i.e.*, they are authorized to direct workers to carry out those activities) that results in a discharge to waters of the United States.

[40 CFR 158.2100(b)] Biochemical pesticide means a pesticide that (1) is a naturally-occurring substance or structurally-similar and functionally identical to a naturally-occurring substance; (2) has a history of exposure to humans and the environment demonstrating minimal toxicity, or in the case of a synthetically-derived biochemical pesticides, is equivalent to a naturally-occurring substance that has such a history;

{108}------------------------------------------------

and (3) Has a non-toxic mode of action to the target pest(s). [40 CFR 158.2000(a)(1)] Plant-incorporated protectant means a pesticidal substance that is intended to be produced and used in a living plant, or in the produce thereof, and the genetic material necessary for production of such a pesticidal substance. It also includes any inert ingredient contained in the plant or produce thereof. [40 CFR 174.3]

{111}------------------------------------------------

for use as a plant regulator, defoliant, or desiccant, and (3) any nitrogen stabilizer, except that the term “pesticide” shall not include any article that is a “new animal drug” within the meaning of section 201(w) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321(w)), that has been determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services not to be a new animal drug by a regulation establishing conditions of use for the article, or that is an animal feed within the meaning of section 201(x) of such Act (21 U.S.C. 321(x)) bearing or containing a new animal drug. The term “pesticide” does not include liquid chemical sterilant products (including any sterilant or subordinate disinfectant claims on such products) for use on a critical or semi-critical device as defined in section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321). For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term “critical device” includes any device that introduced directly into the human body, either into or in contact with the bloodstream or normally sterile areas of the body and the term “semi-critical device” includes any device that contacts intact mucous membranes but which does not ordinarily penetrate the blood barrier or otherwise enter normally sterile areas of the body [FIFRA Section 2(u)].

The term “pesticide” applies to insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, rodenticides, and various other substances used to control pests. The definition encompasses all uses of pesticides authorized under FIFRA including uses authorized under sections 3 (registration), 5 (experimental use permits), 18 (emergency exemptions), 24(c) (special local needs registrations), and 25(b) (exemptions from FIFRA).

Note: drugs used to control diseases of humans or animals (such as livestock, fishstock and pets) are not considered pesticides; such drugs are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. Fertilizers, nutrients, and other substances used to promote plant survival and health are not considered plant growth regulators and thus are not pesticides. Biological control agents, except for certain microorganisms, are exempted from regulation under FIFRA. (Biological control agents include beneficial predators such as birds or ladybugs that eat insect pests, parasitic wasps, fish, etc).

*This permit uses the term “pesticide” when referring to the “pesticide, as applied.” When referring to the chemical in the pesticide product with pesticidal qualities, the permit uses the term “active ingredient.”*

**Pesticide Discharges To Waters of the United States from Pesticide Application** - means the discharges that result from the application of biological pesticides, and the application of chemical pesticides that leave a residue, from point sources to waters of the United States. In the context of this definition of pesticide discharges to waters of the United States from pesticide application, this does not include agricultural storm water discharges and return flows from irrigated agriculture, which are excluded by law (33 U.S.C. 1342(1); 33 U.S.C. 1362(14)). [40 CFR 122.2]

*This permit uses the term “pesticide discharges” when referring to “pesticide discharges to waters of the United States from pesticide application.”*

**Pesticide Product** – a pesticide in the particular form (including composition, packaging, and labeling) in which the pesticide is, or is intended to be, distributed or sold. The term includes any physical apparatus used to deliver or apply the pesticide if distributed or sold with the pesticide.

{112}------------------------------------------------

**Pesticide Research and Development** – Activities undertaken on a systematic basis to gain new knowledge (research) and/or the application of research findings or other scientific knowledge for the creation of new or significantly improved products or processes (experimental development).

**Pesticide Residue** – for the purpose of determining whether an NPDES permit is needed for discharges to waters of the United States from pesticide application, means that portion of a pesticide application that is discharged from a point source to waters of the United States and no longer provides pesticidal benefits. It also includes any degradates of the pesticide. [40 CFR 122.2]

**Point Source** – any discernible, confined, and discrete conveyance, including but not limited to any pipe, ditch, channel, tunnel, conduit, well, discrete fissure, container, rolling stock, concentrated animal feeding operation, landfill leachate collection system, vessel, or other floating craft from which pollutants are or may be discharged. This term does not include return flows from irrigated agriculture or agricultural stormwater runoff. [40 CFR 122.2]

**Pollutant** – dredged spoil, solid waste, incinerator residue, filter backwash, sewage, garbage, sewage sludge, munitions, chemical wastes, biological materials, heat, wrecked or discarded equipment, rock, sand, cellar dirt, and industrial, municipal, and agricultural waste discharged into water. For purposes of this definition, a “biological pesticide” is considered a “biological material,” and any “pesticide residue” resulting from use of a “chemical pesticide” is considered a “chemical waste.” [Excerpted from 40 CFR 122.2]

**Project Action Area** – all areas to be affected directly or indirectly by the Operator’s discharge(s) to waters of the U.S. covered by the PGP and discharge-related activities in the Operator’s pest management area(s).

**Small Entity** – any (1) private enterprise that does not exceed the Small Business Administration size standard as identified at 13 CFR 121.201, or (2) local government that serves a population of 10,000 or less.

**State** – means any of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Guam, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.

**Take** - means to harass, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to attempt to engage in any such conduct. See Section 3 of the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. § 1532 (19).

**Target Pest** – the organism(s) toward which Pest Management Measures are being directed.

**Tier 3 Waters** – for antidegradation purposes, pursuant to 40 CFR 131.12(a)(3), Tier 3 waters are identified by states or Tribes as having high quality waters constituting an Outstanding National Resource Water (ONRW), which may include waters of National Parks and State Parks, wildlife refuges, and waters of exceptional recreational or ecological significance.

**Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs)** – a TMDL is a calculation of the maximum amount of a pollutant that a water body can receive and still meet water quality standards, and an allocation of that amount to the pollutant’s sources. A TMDL includes wasteload allocations (WLAs) for point source discharges, load allocations (LAs) for nonpoint sources and/or natural background,

{113}------------------------------------------------

and it must include a margin of safety (MOS) and account for seasonal variations. [See section 303(d) of the CWA and 40 CFR 130.2 and 130.7]

**Treatment Area** – the entire area, whether over land or water, where a pesticide application is intended to provide pesticidal benefits within the pest management area. In some instances, the treatment area will be larger than the area where pesticides are actually applied. For example, the treatment area for a stationary drip treatment into a canal includes the entire width and length of the canal over which the pesticide is intended to control weeds. Similarly, the treatment area for a lake or marine area is the water surface area where the application is intended to provide pesticidal benefits.

**Water Quality Impaired** – See ‘Impaired Water.’

**Water Quality Standards** – A water quality standard defines the water quality goals of a water body, or portion thereof, by designating the use or uses to be made of the water and by setting criteria necessary to protect the uses. Water quality standards also include an antidegradation policy and implementation procedures. See *P.U.D. No. 1 of Jefferson County v. Wash. Dept. of Ecology*, 511 U.S. 700, 705 (1994). States, Tribes and EPA adopt water quality standards to protect public health or welfare, enhance the quality of water and serve the purposes of the CWA (See CWA sections 101(a)2 and 303(c)). Where necessary, EPA has the authority to promulgate federal water quality standards.

**Wetlands** – means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. [40 CFR 122.2]

## Appendix B. Standard Permit Conditions

As provided by the introductory text of 40 CFR §122.41 and the regulation at 40 CFR §122.43(c), all of the standard permit conditions published in federal regulations at 40 CFR §122.41 are included below. [Note: Penalties for Violations of Permit Conditions: EPA and other federal agencies are required to adjust their maximum and minimum statutory civil penalty amounts through rulemaking by January 15 each year to account for inflation. EPA's annual rulemaking adjustments, codified in 40 C.F.R. § 19.4, are mandated by the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, as amended through the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvement Act of 2015 (28 U.S.C. § 2461 note). As such, the civil penalty amounts below have changed and will likely change in the future due to inflation. See 40 C.F.R. § 19.4 for the most up-to-date civil penalty amounts.]

40 CFR § 122.41 - Conditions applicable to all permits.

The following conditions apply to all NPDES permits. Additional conditions applicable to NPDES permits are in §122.42. All conditions applicable to NPDES permits shall be incorporated into the permits either expressly or by reference. If incorporated by reference, a specific citation to these regulations (or the corresponding approved State regulations) must be given in the permit.

(a) *Duty to comply.* The permittee must comply with all conditions of this permit. Any permit noncompliance constitutes a violation of the Clean Water Act and is grounds for enforcement action; for permit termination, revocation and reissuance, or modification; or denial of a permit renewal application.

(1) The permittee shall comply with effluent standards or prohibitions established under section 307(a) of the Clean Water Act for toxic pollutants and with standards for sewage sludge use or disposal established under section 405(d) of the CWA within the time provided in the regulations that establish these standards or prohibitions or standards for sewage sludge use or disposal, even if the permit has not yet been modified to incorporate the requirement.

(2) The Clean Water Act provides that any person who violates section 301, 302, 306, 307, 308, 318 or 405 of the Act, or any permit condition or limitation implementing any such sections in a permit issued under section 402, or any requirement imposed in a pretreatment program approved under sections 402(a)(3) or 402(b)(8) of the Act, is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed \$25,000 per day for each violation. [See 40 CFR 19.4 for the most up-to date civil penalty amounts.]

The Clean Water Act provides that any person who *negligently* violates sections 301, 302, 306, 307, 308, 318, or 405 of the Act, or any condition or limitation implementing any of such sections in a permit issued under section 402 of the Act, or any requirement imposed in a pretreatment program approved under section 402(a)(3) or 402(b)(8) of the Act, is subject to criminal penalties of \$2,500 to \$25,000 per day of violation, or imprisonment of not more than 1 year, or both. In the case of a second or subsequent conviction for a negligent violation, a person shall be subject to criminal penalties of not more than \$50,000 per day of violation, or by

{116}------------------------------------------------

imprisonment of not more than 2 years, or both. Any person who *knowingly* violates such sections, or such conditions or limitations is subject to criminal penalties of \$5,000 to \$50,000 per day of violation, or imprisonment for not more than 3 years, or both. In the case of a second or subsequent conviction for a knowing violation, a person shall be subject to criminal penalties of not more than \$100,000 per day of violation, or imprisonment of not more than 6 years, or both. Any person who knowingly violates section 301, 302, 303, 306, 307, 308, 318 or 405 of the Act, or any permit condition or limitation implementing any of such sections in a permit issued under section 402 of the Act, and who knows at that time that he thereby places another person in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury, shall, upon conviction, be subject to a fine of not more than \$250,000 or imprisonment of not more than 15 years, or both. In the case of a second or subsequent conviction for a knowing endangerment violation, a person shall be subject to a fine of not more than \$500,000 or by imprisonment of not more than 30 years, or both. An organization as defined in section 309(c)(3)(B)(iii) of the CWA shall, upon conviction of violating the imminent danger provision, be subject to a fine of not more than \$1,000,000 and can be fined up to \$2,000,000 for second or subsequent convictions.

Part 127 is not intended to undo existing requirements for electronic reporting. Prior to this date, and independent of Part 127, permittees may be required to report electronically if specified by a particular permit or if required to do so by state law.

(ii) If the permittee monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the permit using test procedures approved under 40 CFR Part 136, or another method required for an industry-specific waste stream under 40 CFR subchapters N or O, the results of such monitoring shall be included in the calculation and reporting of the data submitted in the DMR or sludge reporting form specified by the (iii) Calculations for all limitations which require averaging of measurements shall utilize an arithmetic mean unless otherwise specified by the Director in the permit.

(5) *Compliance schedules.* Reports of compliance or noncompliance with, or any progress reports on, interim and final requirements contained in any compliance schedule of this permit shall be submitted no later than 14 days following each schedule date.

(6) *Twenty-four hour reporting.*

(i) The permittee shall report any noncompliance which may endanger health or the environment. Any information shall be provided orally within 24 hours from the time the permittee becomes aware of the circumstances. A report shall also be provided within 5 days of the time the permittee becomes aware of the circumstances. The report shall contain a description of the noncompliance and its cause; the period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times), and if the noncompliance has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is

{120}------------------------------------------------

expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the noncompliance. For noncompliance events related to combined sewer overflows, sanitary sewer overflows, or bypass events, these reports must include the data described above (with the exception of time of discovery) as well as the type of event (combined sewer overflows, sanitary sewer overflows, or bypass events), type of sewer overflow structure (e.g., manhole, combine sewer overflow outfall), discharge volumes untreated by the treatment works treating domestic sewage, types of human health and environmental impacts of the sewer overflow event, and whether the noncompliance was related to wet weather. As of December 21, 2020, all reports related to combined sewer overflows, sanitary sewer overflows, or bypass events submitted in compliance with this section must be submitted electronically by the permittee to the Director or initial recipient as defined in 40 CFR 127.2(b) in compliance with this section and 40 CFR Part 3 (including, in all cases, subpart D to Part 3), §122.22, and 40 CFR Part 127. Part 127 is not intended to undo existing requirements for electronic reporting. Prior to this date, and independent of Part 127, permittees may be required to electronically submit reports related to combined sewer overflows, sanitary sewer overflows, or bypass events under this section by a particular permit or if required to do so by state law. The Director may also require permittees to electronically submit reports not related to combined sewer overflows, sanitary sewer overflows, or bypass events under this section.

(ii) The following shall be included as information which must be reported within 24 hours under this paragraph.

(A) Any unanticipated bypass which exceeds any effluent limitation in the permit. (See §122.41(g).)

(B) Any upset which exceeds any effluent limitation in the permit.

(C) Violation of a maximum daily discharge limitation for any of the pollutants listed by the Director in the permit to be reported within 24 hours. (See §122.44(g).)

(iii) The Director may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis for reports under paragraph (l)(6)(ii) of this section if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.

(7) *Other noncompliance.* The permittee shall report all instances of noncompliance not reported under paragraphs (l)(4), (5), and (6) of this section, at the time monitoring reports are submitted. The reports shall contain the information listed in paragraph (l)(6). For noncompliance events related to combined sewer overflows, sanitary sewer overflows, or bypass events, these reports shall contain the information described in paragraph (l)(6) and the applicable required data in appendix A to 40 CFR Part 127. As of December 21, 2020 all reports related to combined sewer overflows, sanitary sewer overflows, or bypass events submitted in compliance with this section must be submitted electronically by the permittee to the Director or initial recipient as defined in 40 CFR 127.2(b) in compliance with this section and 40 CFR Part 3 (including, in all cases, subpart D to Part 3), §122.22, and 40 CFR Part 127. Part 127 is not intended to undo existing requirements for electronic reporting. Prior to this date, and independent of Part 127, permittees may be required to electronically submit reports related to combined sewer overflows, sanitary sewer overflows, or bypass events under this section by a

{121}------------------------------------------------

particular permit or if required to do so by state law. The Director may also require permittees to electronically submit reports not related to combined sewer overflows, sanitary sewer overflows, or bypass events under this section.

(8) *Other information.* Where the permittee becomes aware that it failed to submit any relevant facts in a permit application or submitted incorrect information in a permit application or in any report to the Director, it shall promptly submit such facts or information.

(9) *Identification of the initial recipient for NPDES electronic reporting data.* The owner, operator, or the duly authorized representative of an NPDES-regulated entity is required to electronically submit the required NPDES information (as specified in appendix A to 40 CFR Part 127) to the appropriate initial recipient, as determined by EPA, and as defined in §127.2(b) of this chapter. EPA will identify and publish the list of initial recipients on its Web site and in the FEDERAL REGISTER, by state and by NPDES data group [see §127.2(c) of this chapter]. EPA will update and maintain this listing.

(m) *Bypass*—(1) *Definitions.* (i) *Bypass* means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a treatment facility.

(ii) *Severe property damage* means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.

(2) *Bypass not exceeding limitations.* The permittee may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause effluent limitations to be exceeded, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of paragraphs (m)(3) and (m)(4) of this section.

(3) *Notice*—(i) *Anticipated bypass.* If the permittee knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice, if possible at least ten days before the date of the bypass. As of December 21, 2020 all notices submitted in compliance with this section must be submitted electronically by the permittee to the Director or initial recipient as defined in 40 CFR 127.2(b) in compliance with this section and 40 CFR Part 3 (including, in all cases, subpart D to Part 3), §122.22, and 40 CFR Part 127. Part 127 is not intended to undo existing requirements for electronic reporting. Prior to this date, and independent of Part 127, permittees may be required to report electronically if specified by a particular permit or if required to do so by state law.

(ii) *Unanticipated bypass.* The permittee shall submit notice of an unanticipated bypass as required in paragraph (1)(6) of this section (24-hour notice). As of December 21, 2020 all notices submitted in compliance with this section must be submitted electronically by the permittee to the Director or initial recipient as defined in 40 CFR 127.2(b) in compliance with this section and 40 CFR Part 3 (including, in all cases, subpart D to Part 3), §122.22, and 40 CFR Part 127. Part 127 is not intended to undo existing requirements for electronic reporting. Prior to this date, and independent of Part 127, permittees may be required to report electronically if specified by a particular permit or if required to do so by state law.

{122}------------------------------------------------

(4) *Prohibition of bypass.* (i) Bypass is prohibited, and the Director may take enforcement action against a permittee for bypass, unless:

(A) Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;

(B) There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and

(C) The permittee submitted notices as required under paragraph (m)(3) of this section.

(ii) The Director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the Director determines that it will meet the three conditions listed above in paragraph (m)(4)(i) of this section.

(n) *Upset*—(1) *Definition.* *Upset* means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with technology based permit effluent limitations because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the permittee. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation.

(2) *Effect of an upset.* An upset constitutes an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with such technology based permit effluent limitations if the requirements of paragraph (n)(3) of this section are met. No determination made during administrative review of claims that noncompliance was caused by upset, and before an action for noncompliance, is final administrative action subject to judicial review.

(3) *Conditions necessary for a demonstration of upset.* A permittee who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:

(i) An upset occurred and the permittee can identify the cause(s) of the upset;

(ii) The permitted facility was at the time being properly operated; and

(iii) The permittee submitted notice of the upset as required in paragraph (l)(6)(ii)(B) of this section (24 hour notice).

(iv) The permittee complied with any remedial measures required under paragraph (d) of this section.

{123}------------------------------------------------

(4) *Burden of proof.* In any enforcement proceeding the permittee seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset has the burden of proof.

#### **D. Endangered Species Protection: Complete Section D for each pest management area for which coverage under EPA's Pesticide General Permit is requested. Copy this section for additional pest management areas.**

Pest Management Area #\_\_\_ of ##\_\_\_

1. Identify the criterion for which you are eligible for permit coverage as it applies to Federally-Listed Threatened or Endangered Species (i.e., Species) and/or Federally-Designated Critical Habitat (i.e., Habitat). A step-by-step guide for determining eligibility is provided in Appendix I of the PGP. Decision-makers are encouraged to use the Endangered Species Act (ESA) eligibility worksheet in Appendix I to help organize the information for preparing this NOI. To be eligible, Decision-makers must meet one of the six eligibility criteria (A-G) for the entire term of coverage under the permit and are required to provide the supporting documentation with the NOI. All criteria require submission with the NOI of a map with geospatial data using the EPA's geospatial mapping tool at <https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting-ESA-procedures> that includes the Project Action Area showing any overlap with FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern and generated within 90 days of NOI submittal. Check one:
  - a.  Criterion A - Pesticide application activities will not result in a point source discharge to one or more waters of the United States or involve discharge-related activities that may expose Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) Listed Resources of Concern and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Listed Resources of Concern to pollutants. If this pesticide application is in response to a Declared Pest Emergency Situation, see Criterion G.  
You are required to provide a map with geospatial data of the Project Action Area, including the pest management area, and a list of FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern generated within 90 days of NOI submittal that show there are no FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern in the Project Action Area using the EPA geospatial mapping tool at <https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting-ESA-procedures>.
  - b.  Criterion B - This Criterion intentionally left blank.
  - c.  Criterion C - Pesticide application activities for which permit coverage is being requested will discharge to one or more waters of the United States and/or involve discharge-related activities that may expose FWS Listed Resources and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern to pollutants, but all "take" of these resources associated with such pesticide application activities has been authorized through FWS' and/or NMFS' issuance of a permit under Section 10 of the ESA, and such authorization addresses the effects of the pesticide discharges to waters of the United States and discharge-related activities on federally-listed species and federally-designated critical habitat based on a list of FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern generated within 90 days of NOI submittal. (The term "take" means to harass, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to attempt to engage in any such conduct. See Section 3 of the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. § 1532 (19).)  
You are required to provide any tracking numbers of identifiers associated with the section 10 permit, the date the Section 10 permit was granted, whether the permit was granted by FWS and/or NMFS, the field office/regional office(s) granting the permit, the period of coverage provided by the permit, and a statement verifying that the Section 10 permit fully covers the proposed pesticide application activities in the Project Action Area. Attach additional pages as necessary. See Appendix I of the PGP for the worksheet to help organize the supporting documentation needed for Criterion C.
  - d.  Criterion D - Pesticide application activities for which permit coverage is being requested will discharge to one or more receiving waters of the United States and/or involve discharge-related activities that may expose FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern to pollutants, but consultation with FWS and/or NMFS under Section 7 of the ESA has been concluded for pesticide application activities covered under the PGP. Consultations can be either formal or informal, and would have occurred only as a result of a separate federal action. The consultation addressed the effects of pesticide discharges to waters of the United States covered by the PGP and discharge-related activities on federally-listed threatened or endangered species and federally-designated critical habitat based on the list of FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern generated within 90 days of NOI submittal. The consultation must have resulted in either:
    - i. A biological opinion from FWS and/or NMFS finding no jeopardy to federally-listed species and no destruction/adverse modification of federally-designated critical habitat and the Reasonable and Prudent Measures to minimize take have been or are in the process of being implemented in accordance with the biological opinion; or
    - ii. Written concurrence from FWS and/or NMFS with a finding that the pesticide discharges to waters of the United States and discharge-related activities are not likely to adversely affect federally-listed species or federally-designated critical habitat.  
You are required to provide any tracking numbers of identifiers associated with the consultation (e.g., IPaC number, ECO number, ECOSphere codes), the Services field office/regional office(s) providing the consultation, any copies of supporting correspondence with FWS and/or NMFS, identification of the federal action agency(ies) involved, the date the consultation was completed, the period of coverage provided by the consultation, and a statement verifying that the consultation fully covers the proposed pesticide application activities in the Project Action Area. Attach additional pages as necessary. See Appendix I of the PGP for the worksheet to help organize the supporting documentation needed for Criterion D.
  - e.  Criterion E - Pesticide application activities for which permit coverage is being requested in the NOI will discharge to one or more waters of the United States and/or involve discharge-related activities that may expose FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern to pollutants. Such discharges eligible under Criterion E are those where the Decision-maker includes in the NOI written correspondence from FWS and/or NMFS that pesticide application activities performed consistent with appropriate measures will avoid or eliminate the likelihood of any short- or long-term adverse effects to FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern.  
You are required to attach the written supporting correspondence from FWS and/or NMFS and a statement verifying that the coordination fully covers the proposed pesticide application activities in the Project Action Area. Eligibility under this criterion is contingent upon the Decision-maker following the measures described in correspondence from FWS and/or NMFS designed to avoid or eliminate the likelihood of any short- or long-term adverse effects. See Appendix I of the PGP for the worksheet to help identify the supporting documentation needed for Criterion E.
  - f.  Criterion F - Pesticide application activities for which permit coverage is being requested in the NOI will discharge to one or more waters of the United States and/or involve discharge-related activities that may expose FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern to pollutants. Such discharges eligible under Criterion F are those from pesticide application activities that are demonstrated by the Decision-maker as not likely to result in any short- or long-term adverse effect to each FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern.  
You are required to provide the supporting documentation by completing question 2 below for each individual listed species and designate critical habitat. See Appendix I of the PGP for the worksheet to help organize the supporting documentation needed for Criterion F.
  - g.  Criterion G - Pesticide application activities were, or will be, discharged to one or more waters of the United States and/or involve discharge-related activities in response to a Declared Pest Emergency Situation. To be eligible for coverage, Decision-makers must notify and coordinate with FWS and NMFS as soon as possible after determining that pesticide application is required in response to a Declared Pest Emergency Situation and prior to discharges.  
You are required to provide the supporting documentation by completing question 2 below *and providing a statement verifying the notification and coordination with FWS and/or NMFS.* See Appendix I of the PGP for the worksheet to help organize the supporting documentation needed for Criterion G.

2. If you checked Criterion F or Criterion G above, provide the following information for all discharges to waters of the United States and/or involve discharge-related activities that may expose FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern to pollutants, including all IPaC resource lists identified within the Project Action Area for the pest management area for which permit coverage is being requested. Provide information to demonstrate the basis for your finding for each individual listed species or designated critical habitat. For discharges pursuant to Criterion G, Declared Pest Emergency Situations, information for items a through g should also include any discharges that have already occurred prior to NOI submission as well as the activities you performed in the 15 or 30 day period before submission of this NOI was required. In some cases, implementation of Pest Management Measures as specified in the permit involves a degree of "adaptive management" such that exact timing and quantities of applications cannot be determined in advance for the duration of the permit. In such cases, the permittee must provide the required information to the extent feasible and consistent with the implementation of the selected Pest Management Measures. See Appendix I of the PGP for the worksheet to help organize the supporting documentation needed for Criterion F and Criterion G

Include a statement verifying your notification and coordination with FWS and NMFS. The notification must be in the form of an email that identifies the appropriate FWS, NMFS and EPA contact(s) and includes a description of the action, a map with geospatial data of the Project Action Area, and a list of FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern identified in the Project Action Area or a list from the EPA's geospatial mapping tool showing no FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern occur in the Project Action Area.

One NOI can be submitted for multiple pest management areas in a state for which you are seeking permit coverage; however, no more than one state can be included on any single NOI form.

##### When to File the NOI?

Do not file your NOI until you have obtained and thoroughly read a copy of the permit. A copy of the permit is on EPA's website (<https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting>). The permit describes procedures to ensure your eligibility, prepare the ESA eligibility worksheet (Appendix I), prepare your Pesticide Discharge Management Plan (PDMP), and complete the NOI form questions—all of which must be done before you sign the NOI certification statement attesting to the accuracy and completeness of your NOI. You will also need a copy of the permit once you have obtained coverage so that you can comply with the implementation requirements of the permit. Note: PDMP is not required for 1) any application made in response to a Declared Pest Emergency Situation, as defined in Appendix A of the permit; and 2) any Decision-maker who is required to submit an NOI solely because their application results in a point source discharge to waters of the United States that may expose FWS Listed Resources of Concern or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern to pollutants.

**Approval to Use Paper NOI Form:** Note that you are not authorized to use this paper NOI form unless the EPA Regional Office has approved its use. Where you have obtained approval to use this form, indicate the waiver that you have been granted, the name of the EPA staff person who granted the waiver, and the date that approval was provided.

**For any discharges after October 31, 2026:** Decision-makers meeting the eligibility requirements identified in the Part 1.1 of the permit and Table 1-1 must submit a complete and accurate NOI according to Table 1-2 and Table 1-3 and consistent with the requirements of Part 1.2 of the permit. Note: NOIs submitted under the 2021 PGP are automatically terminated at 11:59 p.m. on October 30, 2026. Decision-makers who are required to submit an NOI must submit a new NOI to obtain coverage under the 2026 PGP.

| Any Decision-maker otherwise required to submit an NOI as identified in Table 1-1. | At least 10 days before any discharge for which an NOI is required.   | No earlier than 10 days after EPA posts on the Internet receipt of a complete and accurate NOI. |

- State, territory and tribal specific requirements in addition to the requirements in this table are provided in Part 9 of the permit.
- On the basis of a review of an NOI or other information, EPA may delay authorization to discharge beyond any timeframe identified in Table 1-2, determine that additional technology-based and/or water quality-based effluent limitations or other limitations or other conditions are necessary, or deny coverage under this permit and require submission of an application for an individual NPDES permit, as detailed in Part 1.3 of the permit.
- Within 30 days after EPA posts on the Internet receipt of a complete and accurate NOI, for those areas with FWS Listed Resources of Concern or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern, FWS and/or NMFS will provide EPA with a determination as to whether it believes the eligibility criterion of “not likely to result in any short-or long-term adverse effects to listed species or designated critical habitat” has been met, could be met with conditions that FWS and/or NMFS identifies, or has not been met. EPA expects to rely on determinations by FWS and/or NMFS in deciding whether to withhold authorization. If FWS and NMFS does not provide EPA with such a determination within 30 days of EPA posting on the Internet receipt of a complete and accurate NOI, the discharges will be authorized 30 days after EPA posts on the Internet receipt of a complete NOI. If EPA identifies or includes additional permit conditions or prohibitions based on recommendations by FWS and/or NMFS as necessary to qualify discharges for particular Operators as eligible for coverage under the PGP, those conditions remain in effect for the life of the permit unless otherwise specified by EPA.
- In any Declared Pest Emergency Situation in areas with waters of the United States that may expose FWS Listed Resources of Concern or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern to pollutants, FWS and NMFS will have 30 days after submission of an NOI to provide EPA with a determination as to whether the eligibility criteria of “not likely to result in any short- or long-term adverse effects to listed species or designated critical habitat” has been met, could be met with conditions that FWS and/or NMFS identifies, or has not been met. EPA expects to rely on determinations by FWS and/or NMFS in deciding whether to disallow continued permit coverage or if additional conditions are necessary. If FWS and/or NMFS do not provide EPA with a recommendation within 30 days of EPA posting on the Internet receipt of a complete and accurate NOI, authorization for these discharges will continue. If EPA identifies or includes additional permit conditions or prohibitions based on a recommendation by FWS and/or NMFS, as necessary to qualify discharges for particular Operators as eligible for coverage beyond 60 days under the PGP, those conditions remain in effect for the term of the permit unless otherwise specified by EPA.
- EPA may authorize certain discharges in less than 30 days, but no fewer than 10 days, for any discharges authorized under Criterion C, D, or E of Part 1.1.2.4 (for which FWS and/or NMFS has already evaluated the effects of these discharges).

##### Completing the NOI Form

To complete this form, type or print in uppercase letters in the appropriate areas only. Please make sure you complete all questions. Make sure you make a photocopy for your records before you send the completed original form to the address above. You may also use this paper form as a checklist for the information you will need when filling an NOI electronically via EPA's NPDES eReporting Tool (NeT).

##### Section A. NOI Status

1. Indicate if this is the first time you are requesting coverage under the permit or if this is a change of information.
- a. Check this box if this is the first time you are requesting coverage under the permit for these discharges. If this is the first time you are requesting coverage, refer to Table 1-2 for NOI submittal deadlines and discharge authorization dates.
- b. Check this box if this is a change of information for a discharge already covered under the permit. If this is a change of information, supply the NPDES permit tracking number that you received in your e-mail from EPA's NeT. You can find the tracking number assigned to your previous NOI using EPA's NeT. For additional details regarding a change of information, see Table 1-3. Also fill out Section B of this form (Operator Name and Mailing Address) and the associated fields of information that need to be modified on the NOI.

##### Section B. Operator Information

1. Provide the legal name of the person, firm, public organization or any other public entity who is the Decision-maker for the pesticide applications described in this notice. A Decision-maker is an Operator who has control over the decision to perform pesticide applications including the ability to modify those decisions that result in a discharge to waters of the United States.
2. Indicate the type of Operator: federal government, state government, local government, mosquito control district (or similar), irrigation control district (or similar), weed control district (or similar), or other. If other, provide brief description of type of Operator in the space provided. If available, indicate the six-digit North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes that represents the economic activity of the Operator.
3. Indicate whether or not you are a "large entity" as defined in Appendix A of the permit. Note that if you are a large entity, you are required to develop a Pesticide Discharge Management Plan (PDMP) and submit future Annual Reports reflecting all pesticide uses for which you are requesting permit coverage under this NOI.
4. Indicate which state your pest management areas are located. Specify only one state per NOI. If there is more than one state, additional NOIs must be submitted.
5. Provide the Decision-maker's mailing address, telephone number, fax number (optional), name, and e-mail address. Correspondence will be sent to this address.

##### Section C. Pest Management Area: Information for each pest management area for which coverage under EPA's Pesticide General Permit is requested.

1. Indicate whether you are submitting an NOI for multiple pest management areas. A pest management area is the area of land, including any water, for which you have responsibility and are authorized to conduct pest management activities as covered by this permit (e.g., if you are a mosquito control district, your pest management area is the total area of the district). You must complete a Section C for each pest management area. If you are submitting an NOI for only one area, enter "1" of "1." If

you are submitting NOIs for multiple pest management areas, enter the number for the NOI for which you are requesting coverage followed by the total number of pest management areas for which you are requesting coverage. Enter the name of the pest management area. Attach a map with geospatial data of the pest management area. Mapping tools are available at <https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting-esa-procedures>. If EPA's geospatial mapping tool is not available, indicate the Latitude and Longitude of the pest management area. The format for this data element is decimal degrees (e.g., 38.893829) and the WGS84 standard coordinate system. To describe two-dimensional area (polygon), use multiple latitude and longitude coordinates.

2. Indicate whether pesticide application will occur on Indian Country, and if so, provide the name of the reservation, if applicable.
3. Indicate whether pesticide application will occur on a Federal Facility, as defined in Appendix A of the permit. If you are on federal land, indicate whether pesticide application will occur on a land of exclusive federal jurisdiction. For assistance, contact EPA Regional offices and summarize the discussion, including description of the pest management area, and attached it to your NOI form.
4. Enter the mailing address of the contact person for the pest management area. If this address is the same as the Decision-maker's mailing address, indicate that by checking the box. If it is a different address, enter the mailing address, telephone number, fax number (optional), contact name, and e-mail address.
5. Indicate the pesticide use patterns for the pest management area for which the NOI is required. For additional information regarding pesticide use patterns, see Part 1.1.1 of the permit. Check all the use patterns that apply to the pest management area.
6. Indicate if permit coverage is being requested for all waters of the United States within the pest management area or if permit coverage is being requested to specific waters of the United States within the pest management area. If specific waters are being requested, write the names of the waterbodies. If permit coverage is being requested for all waters of the United States within the pest management area except for specific waterbodies, name those specific waterbodies in the space provided. EPA's Water Locator Tool can help you identify the closest receiving water to your facility (<http://www.epa.gov/waterdata/waters-tools>).
7. Indicate if permit coverage is being requested to discharge to a Tier 2, Tier 2.5 or Tier 3 (Outstanding National Resource Water) water of the United States. If the discharge is to a Tier 3 water of the United States, write the name(s) of the Tier 3 water(s) in the space provided. Describe and demonstrate why it is necessary to apply the pesticide discharge to protect the water quality, environment, and/or public health and that any such discharge will not degrade water quality or will degrade water quality only on a short-term or temporary basis. Attach the rationale to your NOI form.
8. Verify that waters within the pest management area are either not impaired by substances which are either active ingredients in the pesticide planned for use or degradates of such active ingredients, OR that evidence shows that the target waters in question are no longer impaired. See Part 1.1.2.1 of the permit for more information on discharges to Water Quality Impaired Waters. Indicate if permit coverage is being requested to discharge to waters impaired for pesticide generally, group of pesticides, or active ingredients or degradate of such an active ingredient.

##### Section D. Endangered Species Protection. Complete Section D for each pest management area for which coverage under EPA's PGP is desired.

Identify the pest management areas, corresponding to those in Part C.

1. Coverage under the permit is available only for discharges to waters of the United States and discharge-related activities that are not likely to result in any short- or long-term adverse effects to any species that are federally-listed as endangered or threatened ("listed") under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and not likely to result in any short- or long-term adverse modification or destruction of habitat that is federally-designated as critical under the ESA ("critical habitat") except as provided in Criterion C, D, and for at least 60 days, G, below. For FWS Listed Resources of Concern or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern as defined in Appendix A of the PGP, there are specific criteria for determining eligibility. To demonstrate eligibility, you must meet one or more of the six eligibility criteria (A-G) for the entire term of coverage under the permit and provide supporting documentation. A step-by-step guide with a worksheet for determining eligibility is provided in Appendix I of the PGP. If you received a waiver to file a paper NOI, you must submit a copy of the map and list of all FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern generated through the EPA's geospatial mapping tool for your Project Action Area and your worksheet (Appendix I) with your paper NOI.

2. You must provide a map with geospatial data of the Project Action Area, including the pest management area, using the tools at <https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting-ESA-procedures>. Evaluation of the pest management area must include a list showing any overlap with federally-listed species and/or designated critical habitats generated within 90 days of seeking permit coverage.

{136}------------------------------------------------

3. If you checked Criterion F or Criterion G, you are required to provide the target pest(s), pesticide product(s) to be discharged and method of application, planned quantity and rate of discharge(s) for each application method, number of planned discharges, approximate date(s) of planned discharge(s), and the rationale supporting your determination that you meet the criterion for which the Decision-maker is submitting this NOI and documentation demonstrating the finding of "not likely to result in any short- or long-term adverse effects" for each FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern identified in your Project Action Area. If you certify under Criterion F and do not hear from EPA within 30 days, you may assume your discharge is authorized. For certifications pursuant to Criterion G, indicate whether the discharge is likely to result in any short- or long-term adverse effects to FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern and, if so, any feasible measures to avoid or eliminate such adverse effects. If you are certifying under Criterion G (which allows you to discharge 15 or 30 days before you even submit your NOI after notification and coordination with the FWS and NMFS), your NOI should describe both the pest emergency activities you plan to do after you submit your NOI as well as the activities you performed in that 15 or 30 day period before you had to submit the NOI. See Part 1.1.2.4 and Appendix I of the PGP for more information regarding Endangered and Threatened Species and Critical Habitat Protection.

4. If your discharge is in response to a Declared Pest Emergency Situation, prior to any discharge to waters of the United States and discharge-related activities under Criterion G, Decision-makers must notify and coordinate with FWS and NMFS to be eligible for coverage. Notification shall occur and coordination shall begin as soon as possible after determining that pesticide application is required in response to a Declared Pest Emergency Situation. The notification must be in the form of an email that identifies the appropriate FWS, NMFS and EPA contact(s) and include a description of the action, the pest management area and Project Action Area map, and a list of FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern identified in the Project Action Area or the list from EPA's geospatial mapping tool showing no FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern occur in the Project Action Area.

5. EPA may authorize certain discharges in less than 30 days, but no fewer than 10 days, for any discharges authorized under Criterion C, D, or E (for which FWS and/or NMFS has already evaluated the effects of these discharges). If you certify under one of these criteria and do not hear from EPA within 30 days, you may assume your discharge is authorized.

#### INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE NOTICE OF TERMINATION (NOT) OF COVERAGE UNDER THE PESTICIDE GENERAL PERMIT (PGP) FOR DISCHARGES FROM THE APPLICATION OF PESTICIDES

##### Who Must File an NOT with EPA?

Any Operator required to submit a Notice of Intent (NOI) is required to submit a Notice of Termination (NOT) to end coverage under this permit. However, if EPA notifies the Operator to apply for an NPDES individual permit or alternative general permit, coverage under this permit terminates automatically. Dischargers automatically covered under this permit as identified in Part 1.2.3 of the permit are likewise automatically terminated upon permanent cessation of discharge consistent with any of the criteria identified in Part 1.2.5.3 of the permit. As required in the permit, only certain Operators who are also Decision-makers must submit NOIs. Note: NOIs submitted under the 2021 PGP are **automatically** terminated at 11:59 p.m. on October 30, 2026. Decision-maker who are required to submit an NOI must submit a new NOI to obtain coverage under the 2026 PGP.

If you have questions about whether you need to file an NOT or questions about completing the form, see <https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting> or contact the NPDES eReporting help desk at (877) 227-8965 or Email at [NPDESeReporting@epa.gov](mailto:NPDESeReporting@epa.gov).

#### Instructions for Completing the Pesticide Discharge Evaluation Worksheet (PDEW) for the PESTICIDE GENERAL PERMIT (PGP) FOR DISCHARGES FROM THE APPLICATION OF PESTICIDES

##### Who Must Complete a PDEW?

Any Operator, who is a Decision-maker required to submit a Notice of Intent (NOI) and is a small entity as defined in Appendix A of the permit may complete this Pesticide Discharge Evaluation Worksheet (PDEW) to meet the requirements of Part 7.3 of the PGP.

Pest management area, as defined in Appendix A of the permit, can be a large area (e.g., an entire town) or a very specific well-defined management area (e.g., a lake). Thus, a pest management area can have one or more treatment areas. Operators required to retain the information contained on this worksheet must do so for each treatment area. For treatment areas with the same or similar pests, the Operator can use one worksheet to document pest management activities for those multiple treatment areas.

##### When to Complete a PDEW?

Before any pesticide application, any Operator using this form to meet its obligations under the PGP must complete Section B of this worksheet. Section C, except for the pesticide application end date and total quantity of pesticide applied, must be completed as soon as possible but no later than 14 days after the first pesticide application. The total quantity of pesticide applied and the pesticide application end date must be completed as soon as possible but no later than 14 days after completion of pesticide application for this project.

Any Operator using this form to meet its obligations under the PGP must retain this worksheet for at least 3 years from the date that coverage is granted under the PGP or when the permit expires or is terminated. These Operators must make this worksheet available to EPA, including an authorized representative of EPA, upon request.

##### Completing the PDEW

To complete this form, type or print in uppercase letters in the appropriate areas only. Make sure you complete all questions.

##### Section A. General Information

1. Enter the Operator's full legal name and the existing NPDES Permit Tracking Number assigned by EPA's NPDES eReporting Tool (Net) or EPA's Pesticides Processing Center. You can find the tracking number assigned to your previous NOI using EPA's Net.
2. Enter the full legal name of the person completing the form.
3. Section A should be completed for each pest management area. Indicate which pest management area out of the total number of pest management areas for which the section is being completed (i.e., Pest Management Area 1 of 10 total Pest Management Areas).
4. Enter the name of the pest management area.
5. Identify the pesticide use pattern(s) for the pest management area.
6. For each treatment area, provide a brief description and location description of the treatment area within the pest management area; size of the treatment area in acres or linear feet, and name or location of any waters of the United States to which discharges occur.

##### Section B. Pest Evaluation

1. Identify the target pest(s) and provide a brief description of why pest control is needed.
2. Provide a brief description of any Pest Management Measure(s) implemented before pesticide application. For example, identify if you have performed physical control techniques such as pulling weeds, removing breeding habitat, or trapping animals.

##### Section C. Pesticide Application

1. Provide the company name and contact information of the pesticide Applicator.
2. Enter the date that the pesticide application began and ended.
3. Enter the name of each pesticide product used including the EPA Pesticide Registration Number, the quantity of pesticide applied, and the method used to apply the pesticide (e.g., fixed wing aircraft, backpack sprayer).
4. Indicate if visual monitoring was conducted during the pesticide application and/or post-application. If visual monitoring was conducted, the record must include the date, time, and location where visual monitoring was conducted. If visual monitoring was not performed, provide a brief description of why visual monitoring was not conducted.
5. Indicate if there were any adverse effects identified during visual monitoring. Provide a brief description of any adverse effects that were identified.

##### Section D. Certification

Enter the certifier's printed name and title. Sign and date the form. For more information about the certification statement and signature, see 40 CFR 122.41(k). (CAUTION: An unsigned or undated form will not be accepted.) Federal statutes provide for severe penalties for submitting false information. Federal regulations require this application to be signed as follows:

*For a corporation:* by a responsible corporate officer, means:

- (i) president, secretary, treasurer, or vice-president of the corporation in charge of a principal business function, or any other person who performs similar policy or decision-making functions for the corporation, or
- (ii) the manager of one or more manufacturing, production, or operating facilities, provided the manager is authorized to make management decisions that govern the operation of the regulated activity including having the explicit or implicit duty of making major capital investment recommendations, and initiating and directing other comprehensive measures to assure long-term environmental compliance with environmental laws and regulations; the manager can ensure that the necessary systems are established or actions taken to gather complete and accurate information for permit application requirements; and where authority to sign documents has been assigned or delegated to the manager in accordance with corporate procedures;

*For a partnership or sole proprietorship:* by a general partner or the proprietor; or

*For a municipal, state, federal, or other public facility:* by either a principal executive or ranking elected official.

If the PDEW was prepared by someone other than the certifier (for example, if the PDEW was prepared by a consultant for the certifier's signature), include the name, organization, phone number and e-mail address of the PDEW preparer.

##### Paperwork Reduction Act Notice

The public reporting and recordkeeping burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 1 hour or 60 minutes per response.

##### Instructions for Completing the Annual Reporting Form for the Pesticide General Permit (PGP) for Discharges from the Application of Pesticides

##### Who Must File an Annual Report with EPA?

Any Operator who is a Decision-maker required to submit a Notice of Intent (NOI) and is a large entity as defined in Appendix A of the permit and any Decision-maker required to submit an NOI because of their application results in a discharge to waters of the United States and/or discharge-related activities that may expose FWS Listed Resources of Concern or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern to pollutants, must submit an annual report to EPA each calendar year. Once required to submit an annual report for one year, an annual report must be filed each subsequent year of this permit whether or not you have discharges from the application of pesticides in accordance with Parts 7.6 and 7.7 of the PGP.

##### When to File an Annual Report?

Any Operator required to file an annual report must submit the annual report no later than February 15 of the following year for all pesticide activities covered under this permit occurring during the previous calendar year. If the Operator is required to submit an NOI based on an annual treatment area threshold, the annual report must include information for the calendar year, with the first annual report required to include activities for the portion of the calendar year after the point at which the Operator exceeded the annual treatment area threshold. If the Operator first exceeds an annual treatment area threshold after December 1 in a calendar year, an annual report is not required for that first partial year but annual reports are required thereafter, with the first annual report submitted also including information from the first partial year.

When Operator terminates permit coverage, as specified in Part 1.2.5 of the permit, an annual report must be submitted for the portion of the year up through the date of termination. The annual report is due no later than February 15 of the following year.

##### Where to File the Annual Report?

The Operator must prepare and submit the Annual Report using EPA's NPDES eReporting Tool (NetT) available on EPA's website (<https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting>) unless the Operator is granted a waiver from the requirement to use NetT for submitting the Annual Report. See Part 8 of the PGP for EPA Regional contacts. The Electronic Submission Waiver is at the top of this form.

If you are granted a waiver from using NetT, you must send the Annual Report to one of the addresses listed below.

Form Approved  
OMB No.  
2040-0004

This form is for Operators required to submit a written report of any reportable adverse incidents to the appropriate EPA Regional office and to the state lead agency for pesticide regulation. Where multiple Operators are authorized for a discharge that results in an adverse incident, reporting by any one of the Operators constitutes compliance for all of the Operators, provided a copy of this report is also provided to all of the other authorized Operators within 30 days of the reportable adverse incident.

#### **A. Reportable Adverse Incident**

**Is the adverse incident reportable?** Reporting of adverse incidents is not required under the PGP in the following situations: (a) An Operator is aware of facts that indicate that the adverse incident was not related to toxic effects or exposure from the pesticide application; (b) An Operator has been notified by EPA, and retains such notification, that the reporting requirement has been waived for this incident or category of incidents; (c) An Operator receives information of an adverse incident, but that information is clearly erroneous; or (d) An adverse incident occurs to pests that are similar in kind to potential target pests identified on the FIFRA label except as required in Part 6.4.3, Notification of Adverse Incident to Threatened or Endangered Species or Critical Habitat.

Yes. You must complete this report and submit it to the appropriate EPA Regional office and to the state lead agency for pesticide regulation.

No. STOP. You are not required to complete this report. However, you may consider using this form to document the incident and your rationale for why reporting of the adverse incident is not required. This information may be useful to support your rationale should you be questioned on such.

#### Instructions for Completing and Submitting the Thirty (30) Day Adverse Incident Written Report for the Pesticide General Permit (PGP) for Discharges from the Application of Pesticides

##### Who Must Submit a 30-day Adverse Incident Report?

All Operators who observe or are otherwise made aware of a reportable adverse incident pursuant to Part 6.4 of the permit must submit an adverse incident report.

However, even for those identified adverse incidents for which the Operator is not required to report, EPA recommends that Operators consider using this form to document the incident and the rationale for why reporting of the adverse incident is not required. This information may be useful to support a rationale should this determination be questioned.

An adverse incident, as defined in the Appendix A of the permit, is an unusual or unexpected incident that an Operator has observed upon inspection or of which the Operator otherwise became aware, in which: (1) there is evidence that a person or non-target organism has likely been exposed to a pesticide residue, and (2) the person or non-target organism suffered a toxic or adverse effect. See Appendix A of the permit, for the complete definition of adverse incident.

Where multiple Operators are authorized for a discharge that results in an adverse incident, notification and reporting by any one of the Operators constitutes compliance for all of the Operators, provided a copy of the written report required in Part 6.4.2 of the permit is also provided to all of the other authorized Operators within 30 days of the reportable adverse incident.

##### When to File the Adverse Incident Report

Operators must provide a written report of any reportable adverse incidents to the appropriate EPA Regional office and to the state lead agency for pesticide regulation within 30 days of the adverse incident pursuant to Part 6.4.1.1 of the permit.

##### Where to File the 30-day Adverse Incident Report

The Operator must immediately notify the appropriate EPA Incident Reporting Contact, as identified at <https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting>, of the adverse incident within 24 hours. The Operator(s) must provide a written report of the adverse incident to the appropriate EPA Regional office at the address listed in Part 8 of the permit and to the state lead agency for pesticide regulation (see <http://npic.orst.edu/state1.htm>).

If an Operator becomes aware of an adverse incident affecting a federally-listed threatened or endangered species or federally-designated critical habitats which may have resulted from a discharge from the Operator's pesticide application, the Operator must immediately notify the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) in the case of an anadromous or marine species, (see <http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov>) or the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) in the case of a terrestrial or freshwater species (see <https://www.fws.gov/program/office-of-law-enforcement/contact-us>).

## Appendix I.PGP Eligibility Worksheet for Threatened and Endangered Species Protection

All pesticide applications covered by this permit require a Decision-maker who is responsible for ensuring eligibility under the PGP and submitting a Notice of Intent (NOI) when species and/or designated critical habitat under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) may be exposed to pollutants associated with their discharges and discharge-related activities. Step 1 of this worksheet is to help Decision-makers determine whether ESA-listed species and/or designated critical habitat (Listed Resources of Concern) may be exposed to pollutants in the Project Action Area(s) as a result of pesticide applications made to the pest management area(s).

This worksheet replicates information required for determining ESA eligibility when completing an NOI electronically for coverage under the PGP. It can be used to help a Decision-maker gather the ESA eligibility information needed for NOI submission. It can also be completed by Operators not otherwise required to submit an NOI, to confirm and document that an NOI and annual reporting is not required because FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern are not present in the Project Action Area(s). EPA's geospatial mapping tool at <https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting-ESA-procedures> must be used to determine whether ESA-listed species and/or designated critical habitat (Listed Resources of Concern) may be exposed to pollutants in the Project Action Area(s) as a result of pesticide applications made to the pest management area(s).

### Elements of the Worksheet

- I.1 Introduction
- I.2 Notice of Intent (NOI) Submittal and Review
- I.3 Worksheet
  - Step 1 Determine if FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern are Present in the Project Action Area
  - Step 2 Determine if You Meet the Eligibility Requirements of Criterion B
  - Step 3 Determine if You Meet the Eligibility Requirement of Criterion C or Criterion D
  - Step 4 Determine if Measures Can Be Implemented to Avoid Adverse Effects
  - Step 5 Determine if You Meet the Eligibility Requirements of Criterion F
  - Step 6 Determine if the Pesticide Application is in Response to a Declared Pest Emergency Situation

{159}------------------------------------------------

### Appendix I – PGP Eligibility Worksheet for Threatened and Endangered Species ProtectionI.1 Introduction

Decision-makers must meet one of the following six ESA eligibility criteria (A or C-G) in Part 1.1.2.4 of the PGP for the entire term of coverage under the 2026 PGP. The ESA eligibility criteria are briefly summarized below.

**Criterion A** – No FWS and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern present in the Project Action Area.

**Criterion B** – Placeholder Criterion, and not applicable for PGP.

**Criterion C** – Discharge effects are addressed under an ESA Section 10 permit.

**Criterion D** – Discharge effects are addressed under an ESA Section 7 consultation that has concluded.

**Criterion E** – Discharge effects are addressed through coordination with the Services.

**Criterion F** – Discharge effects are addressed and not likely to result in any short- or long-term adverse effects to FWS and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern.

**Criterion G** – Declared Pest Emergency Situation

If you do not meet any of the ESA eligibility criteria outlined in this worksheet, you are not eligible for coverage under this permit.<sup>2</sup>

#### **Relevant Definitions**

**FWS Listed Resources of Concern** – Federally-listed threatened and endangered species and designated critical habitat listed under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) that are included in FWS biological opinion for EPA’s Pesticide General Permit.

**NMFS Listed Resources of Concern** – ESA-listed species and designated critical habitat under the jurisdiction of National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) that are within, or adjacent to, and/or affected by discharges within, areas where EPA is the permitting authority, as described in Appendix C of this permit.

**Project Action Area** - all areas to be affected directly or indirectly by the Operator’s discharge(s) to waters of the U.S. covered by the PGP and discharge-related activities in the Operator’s pest management area(s).

**Pest Management Area** -- The area of land, including any water, for which an Operator has responsibility and is authorized to conduct pest management activities as covered by this permit (e.g., for an Operator who is a mosquito control district, the pest management area is the total area of the district).

{160}------------------------------------------------

It is important to accurately determine ESA eligibility when seeking permit coverage because Section 9 of the ESA and, in some cases, regulations issued for threatened species pursuant to Section 4(d) of the ESA, prohibit the take<sup>3</sup> of endangered and threatened species, respectively, without an applicable exemption. ESA Section 9 violations can result in civil and even criminal penalties.

**Step 1, described in this worksheet, is necessary for determining eligibility.** Step 1 identifies any FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern that would potentially be exposed to pollutants in the Project Action Area from proposed pesticide applications based on NMFS and FWS authoritative data or data approved by the Services (e.g., an official resource list based on data from IPaC for FWS Listed Resources of Concern). In Step 1, the Decision-maker delineates the Project Action Area affected directly or indirectly by the proposed discharge(s) to the pest management area and obtains a map with a list of potentially exposed ESA-listed species and designated critical habitat using EPA's geospatial mapping tool (<https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting-esa-procedures>)<sup>4</sup>. **The map and the list obtained in Step 1 must be generated within 90 days of seeking permit coverage and submitted with the NOI**<sup>5</sup> if the Decision-maker is required to submit an NOI. If you received a waiver to file your NOI electronically, you must submit a copy of the list generated through the geospatial mapping tool with your paper NOI.

**If FWS and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern are in your Project Action Area,** you must identify and evaluate potential short- or long-term adverse effects of your discharges and discharge-related activities on both FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern<sup>6</sup> in the Project Action Area and identify whether and how effects are or will be addressed in order to select the correct ESA eligibility Criterion. You must comply with any applicable terms, conditions, or other requirements developed in meeting one of the eligibility criteria (e.g., avoidance measures) to remain eligible for coverage under this permit.

If your pest management area overlaps with any water where NMFS' Listed Resources of Concern occur and you expect discharges from the application of pesticides that have a labeled use that a NMFS' biological opinion has determined would jeopardize the continued existence of ESA-listed species and/or adversely modify designated critical habitat, it is in your best interest to contact your regional NMFS office or the Office of Protected Resources in Silver Spring, Maryland and request "technical assistance on potential pesticide applications from an ESA Section 7 biologist." Check the [NMFS Consultation page](#) for the most up to date information on pesticides that have a labeled use that a NMFS' biological opinion has determined would jeopardize the continued existence of ESA-listed species and/or adversely modify designated

The opinions include reasonable and prudent measures and actions to minimize exposure and/or adverse effects to ESA-listed species and critical habitat that may be exposed. A Decision-maker may wish to consider these measures and actions when developing the Pesticide Pollutant Discharge Management Plan.

If your Project Action Area overlaps with areas where FWS' Listed Resources of Concern occur for the pesticides covered under EPA's PGP, see <https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting-esa-procedures> for more information.

### I.2 Notice of Intent (NOI) Submittal and Review

If your discharge to waters of the U.S. and discharge-related activities may expose ESA-listed species to pollutants and you meet any of the eligibility criteria C through G, you must submit an NOI for coverage under the permit. If you can accurately confirm and document that your discharge and discharge-related activities will not expose ESA-listed species to pollutants, you will only be required to submit an NOI if you are otherwise required to submit an NOI as indicated in Table 1-1 of the PGP. In such cases, when you submit your NOI, you identify that ESA eligibility Criterion A applies to your proposed discharge.

After you submit your NOI and before your NOI is authorized, EPA may notify you of any additional controls that are necessary to ensure your discharges to waters of United States and discharge-related activities are not likely to result in any short- or long-term adverse effects on FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern. The Services have the opportunity, within 30 days of submission of the NOI, to advise EPA whether either the planned discharges meet the selected eligibility criterion; the planned discharges could meet the eligibility criterion with additional conditions; or the planned discharges do not meet the eligibility criterion. In the event that EPA has placed a hold on your NOI, EPA will notify you as to whether your discharges are authorized or whether an NPDES individual permit will be required. If you do not hear from EPA within 30 days, you may assume that your discharge is authorized without further conditions. Authorization will remain in effect unless and until notified by EPA that activities identified in the NOI will be reevaluated. If the discharges are in response to a Declared Pest Emergency Situation, you must follow the notification and coordination procedures with the Services prior to discharges, followed by NOI submittal, under Criterion G. Note, if you make changes to your proposed discharges to waters of the United States or discharge-related activities as outlined in Table 1-3 of the permit, then you must reevaluate and update your NOI (if necessary).

{162}------------------------------------------------

### I.3 Worksheet

Follow the instructions below to determine if you are eligible for coverage under the 2026 PGP based on the ESA eligibility criteria in Part 1.1.2.4. of the permit. **Check only one criterion per pest management area and record the required information in your NOI, if applicable.** You may submit one NOI for multiple pest management areas within a state or territory for which you are seeking permit coverage. Complete the worksheet for each pest management area. **Each pest management area can be assigned only one ESA Eligibility Criterion and information supporting the selected criterion must be recorded in, or submitted with, your NOI.** Copy this worksheet for additional pest management areas.

Pest Management Area: \_\_\_\_\_ of \_\_\_\_\_

Pest Management Area Name: \_\_\_\_\_

**Before proceeding with ESA eligibility criteria selection, you must consider the following in determining the Project Action Area, and confirm the following are true:**

In determining my Project Action Area, I have identified and included all receiving waterbodies and adjacent lands that could receive pollutants from my discharges to waters of United States and discharge-related activities within the pest management area.

**Note:** If you have any questions about determining the extent of your Project Action Area, you may contact EPA or the Services for assistance. Contact information is available at: <https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting-ESA-procedures>.

#### Step 1 – Determine if FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern are Present in the Project Action Area

First, you must determine whether there are FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern present within your Project Action Area using EPA’s geospatial mapping tool at <https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting-ESA-procedures>. The tool will provide a resource list and map identifying whether, where, and which FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern may be present in your Project Action Area. If FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern are not present in the Project Action Area, the output from the geospatial mapping tool will not list any species or designated critical habitat.

{163}------------------------------------------------

##### ESA Eligibility Criterion A Requirements

To determine eligibility for coverage under Criterion A, you must use EPA's geospatial mapping tool. One of the following "**I have confirmed**" statements below **must be true** (check the appropriate boxes):

- I confirm that I have used EPA's geospatial mapping tool and my ESA eligibility determination is based on output generated by the tool within 90 days of seeking permit coverage to determine whether any FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern are within my Project Action Area. I have confirmed there are FWS Listed Resources of Concern **or** that there are NMFS Listed Resources of Concern **affected directly or indirectly** in my Project Action Area; (check all that apply and **proceed to Step 3 OR** If your pesticide application is in response to a Declared Pest Emergency Situation, **proceed to Step 6, Criterion G**)
  - FWS Listed Resources of Concern
  - NMFS Listed Resources of Concern
- I confirm that I have used EPA's geospatial mapping tool and my ESA eligibility determination is based on output generated by the tool within 90 days of seeking permit coverage to determine whether any FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern are within my Project Action Area. I have confirmed there are **no** FWS Listed Resources of Concern **and** that there are **no** NMFS Listed Resources of Concern **affected directly or indirectly** in my Project Action Area. If this pesticide application is in response to a Declared Pest Emergency Situation **proceed to Step 6, Criterion G**.
  - NO** FWS Listed Resources of Concern **AND**
  - NO** NMFS Listed Resources of Concern

You can certify that the activity meets Criterion A (check box on the NOI corresponding to Criterion A and submit the supporting documentation (e.g. map with geospatial data that includes the Project Action Area and the list generated through the geospatial mapping tool with no FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern) with the NOI).

Note that if you are not otherwise required to submit an NOI, you do not need to submit an NOI merely to document that you meet eligibility Criterion A. However, if you are required to submit an NOI anyway, you must document on the NOI that you meet eligibility Criterion A. **If you received a waiver to file a paper NOI, you must submit a copy of the map and list generated through the geospatial mapping tool in Step 1 and your worksheet with your paper NOI.**

{164}------------------------------------------------

#### Step 2 – Determine if You Meet the Eligibility Requirements of Criterion B

##### ESA Eligibility Criterion B Requirements

This criterion intentionally left blank. Proceed to Step 3.

#### Step 3 – Determine if You Meet the Eligibility Requirement of Criterion C or Criterion D

##### ESA Eligibility Criterion C Requirements

If you have previously been issued an ESA Section 10(a)(1) permit(s) that fully covers the effects of your proposed discharges to waters of the United States and discharge-related activities on all FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern identified in your Project Action Area (based on the resource lists generated in Step 1 within 90 days of NOI submittal), then your proposed activity may be eligible for coverage under Criterion C.

If you believe an existing ESA-related action may have already been completed for your planned discharges to waters of the United States or discharge-related activities but you are uncertain of the details, you should contact the FWS office and/or NMFS office(s) that covers your Project Action Area (contact information is available at <https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting-ESA-procedures>).

**In order to be eligible for coverage under Criterion C, the following statement must be true for species under the jurisdiction of each Service, as applicable:**

I have confirmed in Step 1 that there are FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern in my Project Action Area.

I can confirm that I have a permit or permits issued under Section 10 of the ESA that specifically addresses the effects of my discharges to waters of the United States and discharge-related activities on all FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern **affected directly or indirectly** in my Project Action Area.

**Issuance of ESA Section 10 permit.** Potential take is authorized through the issuance of a permit under Section 10 of the ESA by the FWS and/or NMFS, as necessary, and this authorization addresses the effects of the discharges to waters of the United States and discharge-related activities on FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern present in the Project Action Area.

**C1.** I confirm that both FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern were considered in my evaluation and that I have used the EPA's geospatial mapping tool as outlined in Step 1. I am providing the map and the list of all FWS Listed

#### Step 5 - Determine if You Meet the Eligibility Requirements of Criterion F

##### ESA Eligibility Criterion F Requirements

The scope of effects that you must consider will vary with each pest management area and Project Action Area. For assistance in determining whether your discharges to waters of the United States and discharge-related activities are likely to result in short- or long-term adverse effects to FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern identified in Step 1, you should contact the appropriate Services office.

**Discharges not likely to result in any short- or long-term adverse effects to FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern.** FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern have been identified in your Project Action Area in Step 1. You may select Criterion F if you self-certified and demonstrated that your discharges to waters of the United States and discharge-related activities are not likely to result in any short- or long-term adverse effects to any FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern. You must demonstrate and document this finding for each

{170}------------------------------------------------

individual listed species or designated critical habitat under the jurisdiction of each Service, as appropriate. You must take appropriate measures, as needed, to avoid or eliminate the likelihood of any short- or long-term adverse effects. For example, you may rely on the specific BMPs to be applied, visual monitoring, equipment and/or site inspections, and other appropriate measures if they would be sufficient to avoid adverse effects. These measures may also include avoiding certain areas, applying pesticides to waters at concentrations below those found to cause adverse effects, or conducting applications only during seasons when FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern are not likely to occur in areas to be exposed. These measures must be identified prior to NOI submission, described in the NOI, and implemented to receive coverage under the PGP.

**In order to be eligible for coverage under Criterion F, you must confirm that the following statement is true for species under the jurisdiction of each Service, as applicable:**

I have confirmed there are FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern **affected directly or indirectly** in my Project Action Area. I can confirm that the following is true.

I can certify that short- or long-term adverse effects to FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern are not likely as demonstrated in the **answers for questions F1 through F7**.

As part of certifying your compliance with Criterion F, you must submit information F1 through F7 to support your findings, including:

I confirm that I have or will implement appropriate measures necessary to avoid the likelihood of any short- or long-term adverse effects to FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern. Yes

**F1.** Provide the map and the list of all FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern from the geospatial mapping tool in Step 1.

**F2.** Target pest(s)

**F3.** Pesticide product(s) to be discharged and method of application

**F4.** Planned quantity and rate of discharge(s) for each method of application

**F6.** Approximate date(s) of planned discharge(s)

{171}------------------------------------------------

**F7.** Your rationale supporting your determination, for each individual listed species and designated critical habitat, that you meet the criterion for which you are submitting the NOI. For example, your determination may rely on the specific BMPs applied, visual monitoring, equipment and/or site inspections, and other appropriate measures that will be undertaken to avoid or eliminate the likelihood of any short- or long-term adverse effects to all FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern.

**If you can confirm the statement above and provide responses to F1-F7 above, you may certify eligibility under Criterion F for this pest management area on your NOI form and include your responses to F1-F7 as the supporting documentation. You are done with this worksheet. If you received a waiver to file a paper NOI, you must submit a copy of the map and list generated through the geospatial mapping tool in Step 1 and your worksheet with your paper NOI.**

If you are unable to provide answers to questions F1-F7 above, you are not eligible under Criterion F. If you have determined that your pesticide application does not align with one of the Criteria above and is not in response to a Declared Pest Emergency Situation (Step 6), your discharges to waters of the United States and discharge-related activities are not eligible for coverage under the PGP. **Proceed to Step 1** if you wish to evaluate again. If you require assistance with your re-evaluation please email [pgp@epa.gov](mailto:pgp@epa.gov) or visit this website: <https://www.epa.gov/npdes/contact-us-pesticide-permitting>.

#### Step 6 – Determine if the Pesticide Application is in Response to a Declared Pest Emergency Situation

##### ESA Eligibility Criterion G Requirements

Discharges to waters of the United States and discharge-related activities that are in response to a Declared Pest Emergency Situation as defined in Appendix A of the permit may be eligible under Criterion G. Prior to any discharge to waters of the United States and discharge-related activities under Criterion G, Decision-makers must notify and coordinate with FWS and NMFS to be eligible for coverage. Notification shall occur and coordination shall begin as soon as possible after determining that pesticide application is required in response to a Declared Pest Emergency Situation. The notification must be in the form of an email that identifies the appropriate FWS, NMFS and EPA contact(s) and include a description of the action, the pest management area and Project Action Area map, and a list of FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern identified in the Project Action Area or showing no FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern occur in the Project Action Area.

{172}------------------------------------------------

As part of any coordination, technical assistance or recommendations provided by the Services for avoiding any short- or long-term adverse effects during the emergency must be implemented as prescribed (either before or after discharge has begun, as applicable) to be eligible for coverage under the permit. The Decision-maker must provide documentation of the coordination and written confirmation from FWS and/or NMFS with the NOI.

If eligible under Criterion G, an NOI must be filed no later than 15 days after beginning to discharge (30 days after beginning to discharge if there are no FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern in the Project Action Area). If you make changes to your proposed discharges or discharge-related activities (per Table 1-3 in the PGP), then you are required to restart this process and coordinate with FWS and/or NMFS again to determine your eligibility under Criterion G.

**In order to be eligible for coverage under Criterion G, you must confirm that one of the following statements are true for species under the jurisdiction of each Service, as applicable:**

**Statement 1:** I have confirmed in **Step 1** that there are FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern **affected directly or indirectly** in my pest management area. My pesticide application is in response to a Declared Pest Emergency Situation, and I have coordinated with the appropriate Service(s)

FWS  NMFS

**Statement 2:** I have confirmed in **Step 1** that there are **no** FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern in my pest management area.
