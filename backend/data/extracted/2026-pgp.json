See Part 1.1.2.4, Table 1-1, and Appendix I for the information Decision-maker must submit with their NOI and for Endangered Species Act (ESA) eligibility criteria that must be met.\n\nFor the purpose of this permit, \u201cOperator\u201d is defined in Appendix A to mean any entity associated with the application of pesticides which results in a discharge to waters of the United States that meets either of the following two criteria: (1) any entity who performs the application of a pesticide or who has day-to-day control of the application (*i.e.*, they are authorized to direct workers to carry out those activities); or (2) any entity with control over the decision to perform pesticide applications including the ability to modify those decisions. Operators identified in (1) above are referred to in this permit as Applicators while Operators identified in (2) are referred to in this permit as Decision-makers. As defined, more than one Operator may be responsible for complying with this permit for any single discharge from the application of pesticides.\n\nFor purposes of this permit, all Operators are defined as either an Applicator or a Decision-maker or both an Applicator and a Decision-maker.\n\nWhen an Operator is both an Applicator and a Decision-maker, the Operator must comply with all applicable requirements imposed on both Applicators and Decision-makers. When the permit references all \u201cOperators,\u201d both Applicators and Decision-makers must comply.\n\n## 1.1 Eligibility\n\n### 1.1.1 Activities Covered\n\nThis permit is available to Operators who discharge to waters of the United States from the application of (1) biological pesticides or (2) chemical pesticides that leave a residue (collectively called *pesticides*), when the pesticide application is for one of the following pesticide use patterns:\n\n- a. **Mosquito and Other Flying Insect Pest Control**\u2014to control public health/nuisance and other flying insect pests that develop or are present during a portion of their life cycle in or above standing or flowing water. Public health/nuisance and other flying insect pests in this use category include mosquitoes and black flies.\n- b. **Weed and Algae Pest Control**\u2014to control weeds, algae, and pathogens that are pests in water and at water\u2019s edge, including ditches and/or canals.\n- c. **Animal Pest Control**\u2014to control animal pests in water and at water\u2019s edge. Animal pests in this use category include fish, lampreys, insects, mollusks, and pathogens.\n\n{4}------------------------------------------------\n\nd. **Forest Canopy Pest Control**\u2014application of a pesticide to a forest canopy to control the population of a pest species (e.g., insect or pathogen) where, to target the pests effectively, a portion of the pesticide unavoidably will be applied over and deposited to water.\n\n### 1.1.2 Limitations on Coverage\n\n#### 1.1.2.1 *Discharges to Water Quality Impaired Waters*\n\nOperators are not eligible for coverage under this permit for any discharges from a pesticide application to waters of the United States if the water is identified as impaired by a substance which either is an active ingredient in that pesticide or is a degradate of such an active ingredient.\n\nFor purposes of this permit, impaired waters are those that have been identified by a state, Tribe, or EPA pursuant to Section 303(d) of the CWA as not meeting applicable state or tribal water quality standards. Impaired waters, for the purposes of this permit, consist of both waters with EPA-approved or EPA-established total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) and waters for which EPA has not yet approved or established a TMDL. A list of those waters is available at <https://www.epa.gov/tmdl/>. If a discharge from a pesticide application would not be eligible under this permit because the water is listed as impaired for that specific pesticide, but there is evidence that shows the water is no longer impaired, Operators may submit this information to EPA consistent with Table 1-2 in Part 1.2.3, and request that coverage be allowed under this permit.\n\n#### 1.1.2.2 *Discharges to Waters Designated as Tier 3 for Antidegradation Purposes*\n\nExcept for discharges from pesticide applications made to restore or maintain water quality or to protect public health or the environment that either do not degrade water quality or only degrade water quality on a short-term or temporary basis, Operators are not eligible for coverage under this permit for discharges to waters of the United States if the water is designated by a state or Tribe as Tier 3 (Outstanding National Resource Waters) for antidegradation purposes under Title 40 of the *Code of Federal Regulations* (CFR) 131.12(a)(3). A list of Tier 3 waters is available on EPA's website at <https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting>.\n\n#### 1.1.2.3 *Discharges Currently or Previously Covered by Another Permit*\n\nDischarges are not eligible for coverage under this permit if any of the following circumstances apply:\n\n- The discharge is covered by another NPDES permit, or\n- The discharge was included in a permit that in the past 5 years has been or is in the process of being denied, terminated, or revoked by EPA (this does not apply to the routine reissuance of permits every 5 years).\n\n#### 1.1.2.4 *Endangered and Threatened Species and Critical Habitat Protection*\n\nCoverage under this permit is available only for discharges to waters of the United States and discharge-related activities that meet one of the ESA eligibility criteria (A through G)\n\n{5}------------------------------------------------\n\nidentified below. EPA\u2019s geospatial mapping tool<sup>1</sup> at <https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting-ESA-procedures> must be used to determine whether ESA-listed species and/or designated critical habitat (Listed Resources of Concern) may be exposed to pollutants in the Project Action Area(s) as a result of pesticide applications made to the pest management area(s). The tool will provide a resource list and map identifying whether, where, and which FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern may be present in the Project Action Area.\n\nActivities that meet one of the ESA eligibility criteria (A through G) are not likely to result in any short- or long-term adverse effects to species that are federally-listed as endangered or threatened (\u201clisted\u201d) under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) or habitat that is federally-designated as critical under the ESA (\u201ccritical habitat\u201d), except as provided in eligibility Criteria C, D, and, for 60 days, G. Under Criteria C and D, effects to listed species and critical habitat have already been addressed through a separate Section 10 permit, or Section 7(a)(2) consultation. Under Criterion G, effects to listed species and critical habitat have already been addressed through the coordination with the Services.\n\nAs one of the provisions in this permit that help limit adverse effects to these resources, the six eligibility criteria (A-G) relate to the impacts a prospective discharger\u2019s activities may have on listed species and critical habitat. Specifically, the conditions in the ESA eligibility criteria relate to potential impacts on Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) Listed Resources of Concern as defined in Appendix A and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Listed Resources of Concern as defined in Appendix A. These are resources that have been identified through consultation with FWS and NMFS on the PGP as having potential exposure to pesticides from discharges and discharge-related activities that warrant the additional protections entailed in compliance with eligibility criteria A-G. Other provisions that protect listed species more broadly include Part 1.6, which requires compliance with any conditions resulting from an ESA Section 7 consultation or ESA Section 10 permit; Part 6.4.3, which requires notification for an adverse incident to threatened or endangered species or critical habitat; and the waiting period between NOI submittal and authorization to discharge, which provides an opportunity for the Services, EPA, and members of the public to identify any potential impacts on listed species and critical habitat, and for EPA to notify the permittee if further conditions or an individual permit are necessary.\n\nA step-by-step guide for determining eligibility with these conditions relating to the protection of FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern is provided in Appendix I, PGP Eligibility Worksheet for Threatened and Endangered\n\n---\n\n<sup>1</sup> If EPA\u2019s geospatial mapping tool is not available, Decision-makers must use IPaC for FWS resource lists and NMFS\u2019 mappers. Links to these tools are available at <https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting-esa-procedures>. If a Decision-maker has a limitation regarding available computer access or computer capability, the Decision-maker may contact EPA or the Services for assistance. Contact information is available at: <https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting-ESA-procedures>.\n\n{6}------------------------------------------------\n\nSpecies Protection. All Decision-makers are encouraged to use the ESA eligibility worksheet in Appendix I to identify the Project Action Area to be evaluated, document the evaluation, and, if an NOI is required, to help prepare their NOI (if a waiver is approved, to submit the worksheet with the paper NOI). The worksheet guides Decision-makers through the determination of whether they meet one of the six eligibility criteria (A through G) identified below, and includes the following:\n\n- identification of the Project Action Area to be evaluated, which may include areas beyond the pest management area that would be exposed to discharges and discharge-related activities;\n- a map with geospatial data of the Project Action Area, including the pest management area, using the EPA's geospatial mapping tool at <https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting-ESA-procedures>;\n- list of any FWS Listed Resources of Concerns and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern (generated within 90 days of seeking permit coverage) that overlap with the Project Action Area, using the tools at <https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting-ESA-procedures>;\n- supporting documentation required to be provided with the NOI as described below.\n\nTo be eligible for coverage under this permit, Decision-makers must meet one of the following six eligibility criteria (A-G) for the entire term of coverage under the permit and, if required to submit an NOI, are required to provide the supporting documentation with the NOI:\n\n**Criterion A.** Pesticide application activities will not result in a point source discharge to one or more waters of the United States or involve discharge-related activities that may expose FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern to pollutants. If this pesticide application is in response to a Declared Pest Emergency Situation, see Criterion G.\n\n*Supporting documentation required with the NOI (if otherwise required) to meet this Criterion - Decision-makers, using the EPA's geospatial mapping tool at <https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting-ESA-procedures>, must provide a map with geospatial data of the Project Action Area(s), including the pest management area(s), and a list of FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern generated within 90 days of NOI submittal that shows that there are no FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern in the Project Action Area.*\n\n**Criterion B.** This Criterion intentionally left blank.\n\n**Criterion C.** Pesticide application activities for which permit coverage is being requested will discharge to one or more waters of the United States and/or involve discharge-related activities that may expose FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern to pollutants, but all \u201ctake\u201d of these resources associated with such pesticide application activities has been authorized through FWS\u2019 and/or NMFS\u2019 issuance of a permit under Section 10 of the ESA, and such authorization\n\n{7}------------------------------------------------\n\naddresses the effects of the pesticide discharges to waters of the United States and discharge-related activities on federally-listed species and federally-designated critical habitat based on the list of FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern generated within 90 days of NOI submittal. (The term \u201ctake\u201d means to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to attempt to engage in any such conduct. See Section 3 of the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1532(19).)\n\n*Supporting documentation required with the NOI to meet this Criterion - Decision-makers are required to provide any tracking numbers or identifiers associated with the Section 10 permit, the date the Section 10 permit was granted, whether the permit was granted by FWS and/or NMFS, and the field office/regional office(s) granting the permit, the period of coverage provided by the permit, and a statement verifying that the Section 10 permit fully covers the proposed pesticide application activities in the Project Action Area. See Appendix D (NOI form) and Appendix I (worksheet) for the information required under Criterion C.*\n\n**Criterion D.** Pesticide application activities for which permit coverage is being requested will discharge to one or more receiving waters of the United States and/or involve discharge-related activities that may expose FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern to pollutants, but consultation with FWS and/or NMFS under section 7 of the ESA has been concluded for pesticide application activities covered under this permit. Consultations can be either formal or informal and would have occurred only as a result of a separate federal action. The consultation addressed the effects of pesticide discharges to waters of the United States and discharge-related activities on federally-listed threatened or endangered species and federally-designated critical habitat based on the list of FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern generated within 90 days of NOI submittal. The consultation must have resulted in either:\n\n- i. A biological opinion from FWS and/or NMFS finding no jeopardy to federally-listed species and no destruction/adverse modification of federally-designated critical habitat and the Reasonable and Prudent Measures to minimize take have been or are in the process of being implemented in accordance with the biological opinion; or\n- ii. Written concurrence from FWS and/or NMFS with a finding that the pesticide discharges to waters of the United States and discharge-related activities are not likely to adversely affect federally-listed species or federally-designated critical habitat.\n\n*Supporting documentation required with the NOI to meet this Criterion - Decision-makers are required to provide any tracking numbers of identifiers associated with the consultation (e.g., IPaC number, ECO number, ECOSphere codes), the Services field office/regional office(s) providing the consultation, any copies of supporting correspondence with FWS and/or NMFS, identification of the federal action agency(ies) involved, the date the consultation was completed, the period of coverage provided by the consultation, and a statement verifying that the consultation fully covers proposed pesticide application activities in the Project*\n\n{8}------------------------------------------------\n\n*Action Area. See Appendix D (NOI form) and Appendix I (worksheet) for the information required under Criterion D.*\n\n**Criterion E.** Pesticide application activities for which permit coverage is being requested in the NOI will discharge to one or more waters of the United States and/or involve discharge-related activities that may expose FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern to pollutants. Such discharges eligible under Criterion E are those where the Decision-maker includes in the NOI written correspondence from FWS and/or NMFS that pesticide application activities performed consistent with appropriate measures will avoid or eliminate the likelihood of any short- or long-term adverse effects to FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern.\n\n*Supporting documentation required with the NOI to meet this Criterion - Decision-makers are required to attach the written supporting correspondence from FWS and/or NMFS and a statement verifying that the coordination fully covers proposed pesticide application activities in the Project Action Area. Eligibility under this criterion is contingent upon the Decision-maker following the measures described in correspondence from FWS and/or NMFS designed to avoid or eliminate the likelihood of any short- or long-term adverse effects. See Appendix D (NOI form) and Appendix I (worksheet) for the information required under Criterion E.*\n\n**Criterion F.** Pesticide application activities for which permit coverage is being requested in the NOI will discharge to one or more waters of the United States and/or involve discharge-related activities that may expose FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern to pollutants. Such discharges eligible under criterion F are those from pesticide application activities that are demonstrated by the Decision-maker as not likely to result in any short- or long-term adverse effects to each FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern identified in the Project Action Area.\n\n*Supporting documentation required with the NOI to meet this Criterion - Decision-makers must provide with their documentation demonstrating the basis for their findings for each individual listed species and designated critical habitat identified in the Project Action Area. See Appendix D (NOI form) and Appendix I (worksheet) for the information required under Criterion F.*\n\n**Criterion G.** Pesticide application activities were, or will be, discharged to one or more waters of the United States in response to a Declared Pest Emergency Situation as defined in Appendix A of the PGP. Prior to any discharge to waters of the United States under Criterion G, Decision-makers must notify and begin to coordinate with FWS and NMFS. Notification shall occur and coordination shall begin as soon as possible after determining that pesticide application is required in response to a Declared Pest Emergency Situation. As part of any coordination, technical assistance or recommendations provided by the Services for avoiding any short- or long-term adverse effects during the emergency should be implemented as prescribed either before or after discharge has begun, as applicable) to be eligible for coverage under the permit. The Decision-makers must provide documentation of the coordination and written\n\n{9}------------------------------------------------\n\nconfirmation from FWS and/or NMFS with the NOI. The Decision-maker must also provide EPA with their rationale supporting the determination whether the discharge is likely to result in any short- or long-term adverse effects to FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern, including the description of appropriate measures that have or will be undertaken to avoid or eliminate the likelihood of any short- or long-term adverse effects.\n\n*Supporting documentation required with the NOI to meet this Criterion - Decision-makers are required to provide information on anticipated applications and provide a rationale for each individual listed species or designated critical habitat as to why any short- or long-term adverse effects did not occur and are not expected, and a statement verifying the notification and coordination with FWS and NMFS. The notification must be in the form of an email to FWS and/or NMFS that identifies the appropriate FWS, NMFS and EPA contact(s) and includes a description of the action, a map with geospatial data of the Project Action Area, and a list of FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern identified in the Project Action Area or a list showing no FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern occur in the Project Action Area. See Appendix D (NOI form) and Appendix I (worksheet) for the information required under Criterion G.*\n\n## 1.2 Authorization to Discharge Under This Permit\n\n### 1.2.1 How to Obtain Authorization\n\nThe following discharges, consistent with the permit eligibility provisions in Part 1.1, are automatically authorized by this permit beginning October 31, 2026.\n\n- Eligible discharges that result from the application of a pesticide as part of *pesticide research and development* as defined in Appendix A. See Part 1.1.2.4 and Table 1-1 for discharges that require an NOI;\n- Eligible discharges for which submission of an NOI is not required. See Parts 1.2.2 and 1.2.3.\n\nTo obtain authorization under this permit for all other eligible discharges, a Decision-maker must submit a timely, complete, and accurate NOI consistent with the requirements of Parts 1.2.2 and 1.2.3.\n\n### 1.2.2 Decision-makers Required to Submit an NOI\n\nAny \u201cDecision-maker who is or will be required to submit an NOI\u201d as defined in Appendix A, is identified in Table 1-1.\n\nFor calculating annual treatment area totals for purposes of determining if an NOI must be submitted, see the definition for \u201cannual treatment area threshold\u201d in Appendix A.\n\nAn NOI provides notice to EPA that a Decision-maker intends to discharge to waters of the United States from pesticide application activities eligible for coverage under this permit. The NOI form included in Appendix D delineates the information required. The NOI must identify the pest management area where the Decision-maker will conduct\n\n{10}------------------------------------------------\n\nactivities resulting in discharges to waters of the United States to be covered under this permit. If the activities will result in discharges to any Tier 3 water eligible under Part 1.1.2.2, the NOI must specifically identify the Tier 3 water by the name listed at <https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting>.\n\n**Table 1-1.

If an Operator was authorized to discharge under this permit before the expiration date, any discharges authorized under this permit will automatically remain covered by this permit until the earliest of the following:\n\n{14}------------------------------------------------\n\n- a. A Decision-maker is authorized for coverage under a reissued permit or a replacement of this permit following the effective date of the new permit or the timely and appropriate submittal of a complete NOI under the new permit, if required, and in compliance with the requirements of the NOI;\n- b. A Decision-maker submits a Notice of Termination (NOT) and that notice is processed and posted on the Internet consistent with Part 1.2.5.1;\n- c. An NPDES individual permit for a discharge resulting from application of a pesticide that would otherwise be covered under this permit is issued or denied;\n- d. EPA issues a formal permit decision not to reissue this general permit, at which time EPA will identify a reasonable period for covered dischargers to seek coverage under an alternative NPDES general permit or an NPDES individual permit. Coverage under this permit will cease when coverage under another permit is granted/authorized; or\n- e. EPA has informed the Operator that its discharge is no longer covered under this permit.\n\n### 1.2.5 Terminating Coverage\n\n**1.2.5.1 Submitting a Notice of Termination (NOT).** To terminate permit coverage, a Decision-maker who is required to submit an NOI as identified in Part 1.2.2 must submit a complete and accurate Notice of Termination. Information required to be included in an NOT is provided in Appendix E of this permit. Decision-makers required to submit an NOT must prepare and submit that information using EPA's NPDES eReporting Tool (NeT) unless NeT is otherwise unavailable, or EPA waives the electronic submission requirement for an Operator consistent with the requirements in Part 7.8. The authorization to discharge under this permit terminates at 11:59 p.m. of the day that a complete NOT is processed and posted on EPA's website at <https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting>. If a Decision-maker submits an NOT without meeting one or more of the conditions identified in Part 1.2.5.2, the NOT is not valid. Decision-makers are responsible for complying with the terms of this permit until authorization is terminated. If required to submit annual reports pursuant to Part 7, prior to the termination of authorization under this permit, Decision-makers must file an annual report for the portion of the year up through the date of termination. The annual report is due no later than February 15<sup>th</sup> of the following year.\n\n**1.2.5.2 When to Submit an NOT.** A Decision-maker who is required to submit an NOI as identified in Part 1.2.2 must submit the NOT within 30 days after one or more of the following conditions have been met:\n\n- a. A new Decision-maker has taken over responsibility of the pest control activities covered under an existing NOI;\n- b. The Decision-maker has ceased all discharges from the application of pesticides for which permit coverage was obtained and does not expect to discharge during the remainder of the permit term for any of the use patterns as identified in Part 1.1.1; or\n- c. The Decision-maker has obtained coverage under an NPDES individual permit or an alternative NPDES general permit for all discharges required to be covered by an\n\n{15}------------------------------------------------\n\nNPDES permit, unless coverage was obtained consistent with Part 1.3, in which case coverage under this permit will terminate automatically.\n\n**1.2.5.3 Termination for Operators not Required to Submit an NOI.** Permit coverage is terminated for Operators covered under this permit who are not required to submit an NOI when there is no longer a discharge from the application of pesticides, or the discharges are covered under an NPDES individual permit or alternative NPDES general permit.\n\n## 1.3 Alternative Permits\n\n### 1.3.1 Requirements for Coverage Under an Alternative Permit\n\nIn accordance with 40 CFR 122.64 and 124.5, EPA may require Operators to apply for and/or obtain authorization to discharge under either an NPDES individual permit or an alternative NPDES general permit.\n\nIf EPA requires an Operator to apply for an NPDES individual permit, EPA will notify the Operator in writing that a permit application is required. Such a notification will include a brief statement of the reasons for the decision and will provide application information. In addition, for Operators whose discharges are authorized under this permit, any notice will set a deadline to file the permit application and will include a statement that on the effective date of the NPDES individual permit, coverage under this general permit will terminate. EPA may grant additional time to submit the application if an Operator submits a request setting forth reasonable grounds for additional time. If the Operator is covered under this permit and fails to submit an NPDES individual permit application as required by EPA, the applicability of this permit to such Operator is terminated at the end of the day specified by EPA as the deadline for application submittal. EPA may take enforcement action for any unpermitted discharge or violation of any permit condition or limitation.\n\n### 1.3.2 Operator Requesting Coverage Under an Alternative Permit\n\nIf an Operator does not want to be covered by this general permit but needs permit coverage, the Operator can apply for an NPDES individual permit. In such a case, the Operator must submit an individual permit application in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 122.26(c)(1)(ii), with reasons supporting the request, to EPA at the applicable EPA Regional Office listed in Part 8. The request may be granted by issuance of an NPDES individual permit or authorization of coverage under an alternative NPDES general permit.\n\nWhen an individual NPDES permit is issued or the Operator is authorized under an alternative NPDES general permit to discharge a pollutant to waters of the United States as a result of a pesticide application, authorization to discharge under this permit is terminated on the effective date of the NPDES individual permit or the date of authorization of coverage under the alternative NPDES general permit.\n\n## 1.4 Severability\n\nInvalidation of a portion of this permit does not render the whole permit invalid. EPA's intent is that the permit will remain in effect to the extent possible; if any part of this\n\n{16}------------------------------------------------\n\npermit is invalidated, the remaining parts of the permit will remain in effect unless EPA issues a written statement indicating otherwise.\n\n## 1.5 Other Federal and State Laws\n\nOperators must comply with all other applicable federal and state (including territorial) laws and regulations that pertain to the application of pesticides. For example, this permit does not negate the requirements under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and its implementing regulations to use registered pesticides consistent with the product's labeling. Operators are advised of their monitoring obligations under FIFRA that, among other things, provide protections for water supplies. In fact, applications in violation of certain FIFRA requirements could also be a violation of the permit and therefore a violation of the CWA (e.g., exceeding label application rates). Additionally, other laws and regulations might apply to certain activities that are also covered under this permit (e.g., United States Coast Guard regulations).\n\n## 1.6 Federally-Listed Endangered and Threatened Species and Designated Critical Habitat\n\nOperators must comply with all conditions and/or requirements that address discharges from activities also covered under this permit resulting from any of the following pre-existing situations:\n\n- a. ESA Section 7 consultation that Operators have completed with FWS and/or NMFS as a result of a separate federal action, and/or\n- b. ESA Section 10 permit issued to the Operator by FWS and/or NMFS as a result of a separate federal action.\n\n{17}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 2.0 Technology-Based Effluent Limitations\n\nThis Part includes technology-based effluent limitations applicable to all Operators as defined in Appendix A for any discharges authorized under this permit, with compliance required upon beginning such discharge.

Note: In an adverse incident affecting federally-listed threatened or endangered species or designated critical habitat, the Operator should leave the affected organisms alone, make note of any circumstances likely causing the death or injury, note the location and number or extent of aquatic organisms involved and, if possible, take photographs. In some circumstances, the Operator may be asked to carry out instructions provided by the Services to collect specimens or take other measures to ensure that evidence intrinsic to the specimen is preserved. For additional information, visit FWS' website at <https://www.fws.gov/program/office-of-law-enforcement/contact-us>, or NMFS website at <https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/topic/enforcement>.\n\nIn the event the Operator observes an adverse incident related to any pests or non-target individuals of plants or animals found to be distressed, dead, or injured in an aquatic or terrestrial area where FWS Listed Resources of Concern or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern may occur, and these types of incidents were not foreseen and addressed on the NOI, the Operator must immediately notify NMFS and/or FWS for assistance. This notification must be made by telephone to the contacts listed on EPA's website at <https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting> immediately upon the Operator becoming aware of the adverse incident.\n\n### 6.4.4 Notification and Reporting for Adverse Incidents Involving Multiple Operators\n\nWhere multiple Operators are authorized for a discharge that results in an adverse incident, notification and reporting by any one of the Operators constitutes compliance for all of the Operators, provided a copy of the written report required in Part 6.4.2 is also provided to all of the other authorized Operators within 30 days of the reportable adverse incident.\n\n## 6.5 Reportable Spills and Leaks\n\n### 6.5.1 Spill, Leak, or Other Unpermitted Discharge Notification\n\nWhere a leak, spill, or other release into waters of the United States containing a hazardous substance or oil in an amount equal to or in excess of a reportable quantity established under either 40 CFR Part 110, 40 CFR Part 117, or 40 CFR Part 302 occurs in any 24-hour period, an Operator must notify the National Response Center immediately\n\n{32}------------------------------------------------\n\nat (800) 424-8802 or, in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area, call (202) 267-2675 in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 110, 40 CFR Part 117, and 40 CFR Part 302, as soon as the Operator has knowledge of the release. Contact information must be in locations that are readily accessible and available in the area where the spill, leak, or other unpermitted discharge may occur.\n\nState or local requirements may necessitate also reporting spills or leaks to local emergency response, public health, or drinking water supply agencies.\n\n### 6.5.2 Thirty-Day Spill, Leak, or Other Unpermitted Discharge Documentation\n\nIf an Operator becomes aware of a spill, leak, or other unpermitted discharge that triggers the notification in Part 6.5.1 and results in an adverse incident, the Operator must report the incident per the guidelines in Part 6.4.1 and 6.4.2. If the spill, leak, or other unpermitted discharge triggers the notification in Part 6.5.1 but does not result in an adverse incident, the Operator must document and retain the following information within 30 days of becoming aware of the situation:\n\n- a. Information required to be provided in Part 6.5.1;\n- b. Summary of corrective action taken or to be taken, including date initiated and date completed or expected to be completed; and\n- c. Any measures to prevent recurrence of such a spill or leak or other discharge, including notice of whether PDMP modifications are required as a result of the spill or leak.\n\n## 6.6 Other Corrective Action Documentation\n\nFor situations identified in Part 6.1 other than for adverse incidents (addressed in Part 6.4) or reportable spills or leaks (addressed in Part 6.5), Operators must document the situation triggering corrective action and document planned corrective action within 30 days of becoming aware of that situation and retain a copy of this documentation. This documentation must include the following information:\n\n- a. Identification of the condition triggering the need for corrective action review, including any ambient water quality monitoring that assisted in determining that discharges did not meet water quality standards;\n- b. Brief description of the situation;\n- c. Date the problem was identified;\n- d. Brief description of how the problem was identified, how the Operator learned of the situation, and date the Operator learned of the situation;\n- e. Summary of corrective action taken or to be taken, including date initiated and date completed or expected to be completed; and\n- f. Any measures to prevent reoccurrence of such an incident, including notice of whether PDMP modifications are required as a result of the incident.\n\n{33}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 7.0 Recordkeeping and Annual Reporting\n\nThe recordkeeping and annual reporting requirements vary depending on the type of Operator, whether a Decision-maker is a small or large entity, or whether a Decision-maker is required to submit an NOI solely because the discharge overlaps with FWS Listed Resources of Concern or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern as defined in Appendix A. Table 7-1 references applicable requirements for the range of Operators covered under this permit.\n\n**Table 7-1: Applicable Recordkeeping and Annual Reporting Requirements for Different Types of Operators**\n\n| PGP Part | Applicable Type of Operator                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 7.1      | Recordkeeping: All Operators                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| 7.2      | Recordkeeping: All Operators who are For-Hire Applicators as defined in Appendix A                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| 7.3      | Recordkeeping: Any Decision-maker required to submit an NOI and who is a <i>small entity</i> <sup>1</sup>                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| 7.4      | Recordkeeping: Any Decision-maker required to submit an NOI and who is a <i>large entity</i> <sup>2</sup>                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| 7.5      | Retention of Records: All Operators                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| 7.6      | Annual Reporting: Any Decision-maker required to submit an NOI and who is a <i>large entity</i> <sup>2</sup>                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| 7.7      | Annual Reporting: Any Decision-maker with discharges to waters of the United States and/or discharge-related activities that may expose FWS Listed Resources of Concern or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern as defined in Appendix A, and who is a <i>small entity</i> <sup>1</sup> to pollutants |\n\n<sup>1</sup>**Small Entity** \u2013 As defined in Appendix A, is any (1) public entity that serves a population of 10,000 or less or (2) private enterprise that does not exceed the Small Business Administration size standard as identified at 13 CFR 121.201.\n\n<sup>2</sup>**Large Entity** \u2013 As defined in Appendix A, is any (1) public entity that serves a population greater than 10,000 or (2) private enterprise that exceeds the Small Business Administration size standard as identified at 13 CFR 121.201.\n\nOperators must keep written records as required in this permit for all discharges covered under this permit.

The specific additional revisions and requirements only apply to activities in those specific states (including territories), Indian Country, and federal facilities. States (including territories), Indian Country, and federal facilities not included in this Part do not have any modifications or additions to the applicable conditions of this permit. Of the state coastal zone management agencies that responded to EPA's consistency determination, each concurred that the permit would be consistent to the maximum extent practicable with the enforceable policies of that state's program, with the exception of Guam, which included a condition to advise Operators of their monitoring obligations under FIFRA that, among other things, assure protection of water supplies. EPA addressed Guam's comment in Part 1.5 of the permit.\n\n## 9.1 EPA Region 1\n\n### 9.1.1 Commonwealth of Massachusetts, except Indian Country\n\n*Applicable to Mosquito and Other Flying Insect Pest Control, Weed and Algae Pest Control, Animal Pest Control, and Forest Canopy Pest Control*\n\n- a. Pursuant to the Massachusetts Water Quality Standards published at 314 CMR 4.00:\n  - i. Discharges to Massachusetts Outstanding Resource Waters, as defined in 314 CMR 4.02 and identified in 314 CMR 4.06, are not eligible for coverage under this Permit unless an authorization is granted by MassDEP pursuant to 314 CMR 4.04(3)(b) and 4.04(5), or the Operator certifies that the discharge complies with general antidegradation authorizations that MassDEP intends to issue. Information regarding authorizations will be available on the MassDEP website.\n  - ii. Operators must use best management practices (as defined in 314 CMR 3.02) to not apply pesticides to vernal pools (as defined in 314 CMR 4.02). This requirement is intended to comply with the protection of vernal pools in 314 CMR 4.06(1)(d)12.\n  - iii. All Operators must control discharges as necessary to meet applicable water quality standards in all surface waters of the Commonwealth, including but not limited to standards for toxic pollutants in 314 CMR 4.05(5)(e).\n  - iv. Operators shall stay informed of EPA's and other investigations related to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) resulting from the storage and transportation of pesticides in storage containers (e.g., fluorinated high-density polyethylene (HDPE) containers) (<https://www.epa.gov/pesticides/pfas-packaging>). MassDEP is closely following this issue and understands and supports EPA continuing its investigation and assessment of the potential impacts on human health and the environment. Although the Pesticide General Permit does not require effluent monitoring, to minimize PFAS release, operators should avoid use of containers, such as fluorinated HDPE containers, that have been demonstrated to leach PFAS into materials stored in the containers, and the use of poly-fluorinated propellants.\n\n{44}------------------------------------------------\n\nOperators are also encouraged, where feasible, to minimize the use of formulations containing poly-fluorinated chemicals, either as active or inactive ingredients. This condition is necessary for compliance with the standards for toxic pollutants at 314 CMR 4.05(5)(e).\n\n- b. Pursuant to M.G.L. c. 132B \u00a7 10, and 333 CMR 10.00, chemical treatments using restricted use pesticides shall only be performed by an applicator currently certified by the Massachusetts Department of Agriculture (MDAR) Pesticide Program in the appropriate category or categories. Pursuant to M.G.L. c. 132B \u00a7 6, and 333 CMR 8.00, pesticides used for treatments must be currently approved for use in the state by the MDAR Pesticide Program and registered by EPA. Chemical application shall be in accordance with the manufacturer's label directions, pesticide use laws, and any conditions imposed by other local or state agencies. Issuance of coverage under this permit does not release the Operator from liability resulting from the negligent or reckless application of chemicals.\n- c. Operators must comply with all applicable state laws and regulations, including but not limited to M.G.L. c. 131 \u00a7 40, and 310 CMR 10.00 (the Wetlands Protection Act and Regulations); M.G.L. c. 131A and 321 CMR 10.00 (the Massachusetts Endangered Species Act and Regulations); and M.G.L. c. 132B and 333 CMR 2.00-14.00 (the Pesticide Control Act and Regulations). The following general requirements also apply:\n  - i. MassDEP may require an Operator under this permit to cease application of chemicals to a body of water at any time if MassDEP determines that the chemical treatment will be ineffective or will result in unreasonable restrictions on current water uses or will produce unnecessary adverse side effects on non-target flora or fauna.\n  - ii. Operators must comply with state law and regulations regarding spills and leaks associated with the application of pesticides covered under this permit.\n\n#### *Applicable to Weed and Algae Pest Control Only*\n\n- d. Pursuant to M.G.L. c. 111 \u00a7 5E, Operators must submit a BRP WM04 application and obtain approval from DEP prior to application of chemicals authorized under this permit. **Notification to MassDEP must be made through the WM04, as required in the WM04 application.** This requirement shall not apply to employees and agents of MassDEP, Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation, Massachusetts Department of Fish and Game, or the State Reclamation and Mosquito Control Board, or of related federal agencies, while in the conduct of their official duties; nor shall it apply to the use of chemicals in privately owned ponds from which there are no flowing outlets, or to algacides approved by MassDEP and used by legally established water supply agencies to control taste and odors.\n- e. Pursuant to M.G.L. c. 111 \u00a7 5E, Operators must implement the following conditions for the use of alum:\n  - i. In all cases the chemicals added may not cause or contribute to any fish kill, including fish spawning, or other negative aquatic impact.\n  - ii. pH and alkalinity: The pH of the pond or lake water must be maintained within a pH range of 6.5 \u2013 8.3 to minimize potential aluminum solubility and toxicity.\n\n{45}------------------------------------------------\n\nDuring treatment, testing should include, at a minimum, 3 pH profiles throughout the treatment area using a calibrated meter, and measurement intervals should include surface, bottom, and 3 equally spaced measures in between. If, during treatment, the pond has an ambient pH outside this range the applicant should adjust the treatment as needed to attain the pH range. If the final pH after treatment is still not within the range, then water samples from treated and untreated areas should be sampled and analyzed for total aluminum and dissolved aluminum with detection limits of 10 ppb or less.\n\n- iii. Reporting: Any observations of dead, dying or stressed fish or freshwater shellfish (e.g., fish swimming at the surface; mussels gaping) or wildlife during or immediately after the approved treatment shall be reported as quickly as possible to the Massachusetts Environmental Police (MEP) Radio Room at 800- 632-8075. Any pH reading outside the target range of 6.5 \u2013 8.3 should be further investigated and reported to MassDEP. All required water quality monitoring data, fish and wildlife observations and a narrative description of the treatment, including any on-site modifications to the application plan to maintain pH within the desired range shall be included in the report to MassDEP certifying the treatment specifics.\n- f. Pursuant to M.G.L. c. 111 \u00a7 5E, shoreline areas of a lake or pond must be posted with signs warning the general public of any water use restrictions stated on the chemical label, or otherwise required by MassDEP or other state agencies, for a minimum of one week. This is especially important at bathing beaches and other areas of common access. The signs shall clearly state that the chemical treatment is being conducted pursuant to a permit issued by the EPA and MassDEP. A new sign shall be posted for each treatment event.\n\n#### *Applicable to Mosquito and Other Flying Insect Pest Control only*\n\n- g. Pursuant to M.G.L. c. 132B \u00a7 10, 333 CMR 10.00, and M.G.L. c. 252, chemical treatments must be performed by an applicator currently licensed/certified by the MDAR Pesticide Program and in accordance with M.G.L. c. 252 and any provisions or policies instituted by the State Reclamation and Mosquito Control Board.\n- h. Pursuant to M.G.L. c. 132B and 333 CMR 14.00, Operators must adhere to the public notification provisions of the Child Protection Act (Chapter 85 of the Acts of 2000) when applicable.\n\n### 9.1.2 Indian Country within the State of Massachusetts - a.

In general, the antidegradation review requirements described in this guidance apply to regulated discharges that have the potential to degrade water quality. These include NPDES point source discharges regulated under Section 402 of the CWA; discharges which result in the placement of dredged or fill material into surface waters regulated under Section 404 of the CWA; and any discharge authorized by federal permits and licenses that are subject to state water quality certification under Section 401 of the CWA.\n\n### 3.5 General NPDES Permits\n\nA number of discharges to surface waters are authorized under general NPDES permits. These include stormwater runoff from municipalities required to comply with the Phase II MS4 stormwater permit, industrial activities covered by the stormwater program (Multi Sector General Permits), stormwater from construction sites one acre or larger (Construction General Permits), pesticide applications in or adjacent to surface waters (Pesticide General Permit), and concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs).\n\n{57}------------------------------------------------\n\nCompliance with the terms and conditions of the general permits is required to maintain authorization to discharge under the general permit. Discharges covered by a general permit that do not comply with general permit conditions or antidegradation requirements will be required to seek coverage under an individual permit.\n\n#### *Overview of the Antidegradation Review for General Permits*\n\nRegulated discharges authorized by general permits are not required to undergo a Tier 2 antidegradation review as part of the permitting process. However, new and reissued general permits must be evaluated to consider the potential for significant degradation as a result of the permitted discharges.\n\nDischarges that comply with general permits are not likely to cause significant degradation of water quality. In addition, activities covered under general permits (e.g., construction, industries, municipalities, dairies, feedlots, etc.) are considered to have social and economic importance to New Mexico. Therefore, antidegradation review for general permits will be based on whether or not the permit conditions are met and if the BMPs are effective at limiting (or eliminating) pollutant loading to minimize water quality impacts.\n\nEPA Region 6's Procedures for Implementing NPDES Permits in New Mexico (NMIP) The NMIP states:\n\n### III.

Water clarification products must only be used in waterbodies with no discharge to other surface waters of the State during and for two weeks after treatment.\n\n##### b) Conditions for Littoral Zone Limitations for Native Nuisance Plants\n\n- 1. The Project proponent is authorized to apply chemicals to: A percentage of a water body's littoral zone based on the littoral acres of the water body and the size of the water body.\n- 2. The geographic area where the Project proponent intentionally applies chemicals must remain the same for the entire length of the permit coverage up to the maximum percentage of the littoral zone allowed for by water body size.\n- 3. All untreated littoral areas must include native vegetation from the shore to the edge of the littoral zone where the plants stop growing in deeper water.\n- 4. The cumulative percentage of the littoral zone where herbicides are authorized to be applied must not exceed the amount allowed below:\n  - i. In water bodies up to 15 acres in size, the Project proponent is authorized to apply herbicides to no more than 75 percent of the littoral zone.\n  - ii. In water bodies over 15 acres and up to 50 acres in size, the Project proponent is authorized to apply herbicides to no more than 60 percent of the littoral zone.\n  - iii. In water bodies over 50 acres and up to 500 acres in size, the Project proponent is authorized to apply herbicides to no more than 50 percent of the littoral zone.\n  - iv.

The Project proponent is authorized to apply herbicides to 100 percent of the plants within the right-of-way and on levees and dikes.\n2. The Project proponent is authorized to apply herbicides to no more than 40 percent of native vegetation on shorelines, roadsides and ditches, but is authorized to apply herbicide to 100 percent of any noxious or quarantine-listed weeds.\n\nNote: Ecology recognizes that discharge permits can regulate the specific areas where a Project proponent discharges (or intentionally applies) a chemical. A discharge permit cannot regulate or control the extent of dispersion because it varies depending on environmental conditions. Dispersion means that sometimes the treatment affects more area or less area than anticipated.\n\n##### d) Conditions for Algae Control\n\n1. The Project proponent may intentionally apply algaecides to filamentous green algae provided the treated areas do not exceed the maximum amount of littoral zone allowed according to the waterbody's size.\n2. The Project proponent may intentionally apply algaecides to the entire waterbody or sections of the waterbody, as needed, when cyanobacteria or other potentially toxic or environmentally harmful algae species are in the waterbody.\n3. Restrictions for algaecide treatments are as follows:\n4. If a Project proponent must conduct a full-waterbody pesticide (or algaecide) treatment for algae:\n  - i. Project proponents must take at minimum one dissolved oxygen measurement approximately 24 hours prior to the planned algae treatment.

Definitions\n\n**Action Area** \u2013 all areas to be affected directly or indirectly by the Federal action (i.e., the PGP) and not merely the immediate area involved in the action. (See 50 CFR 402.02).\n\n**Action Threshold** \u2013 the point at which pest populations or environmental conditions necessitate that pest control action be taken based on economic, human health, aesthetic, or other effects. An action threshold may be based on current and/or past environmental factors that are or have been demonstrated to be conducive to pest emergence and/or growth, as well as past and/or current pest presence. Action thresholds are those conditions that indicate both the need for control actions and the proper timing of such actions.\n\n**Active Ingredient** \u2013 any substance (or group of structurally similar substances if specified by the Agency) that will prevent, destroy, repel or mitigate any pest, or that functions as a plant regulator, desiccant, or defoliant within the meaning of FIFRA sec. 2(a). [40 CFR 152.3] Active ingredient also means a pesticidal substance that is intended to be produced and used in a living plant, or in the produce thereof, and the genetic material necessary for the production of such a pesticidal substance. [40 CFR 174.3]\n\n**Adverse Incident** \u2013 means an unusual or unexpected incident that an Operator has observed upon inspection or of which the Operator otherwise become aware, in which:\n\n- (1) There is evidence that a person or non-target organism has likely been exposed to a pesticide residue, and\n- (2) The person or non-target organism suffered a toxic or adverse effect.\n\nThe phrase toxic or adverse effect includes effects that occur as a result of a discharge to waters of the United States on non-target plants, fish, or wildlife that are unusual or unexpected (e.g., effects are to organisms not otherwise described on the pesticide product label or otherwise not expected to be present) as a result of exposure to a pesticide residue, and may include:\n\n- Distressed or dead juvenile and small fishes\n- Washed up or floating fish\n- Fish swimming abnormally or erratically\n- Fish lying lethargically at water surface or in shallow water\n- Fish that are listless or nonresponsive to disturbance\n- Stunting, wilting, or desiccation of non-target submerged or emergent aquatic plants\n- Other dead or visibly distressed non-target aquatic organisms (amphibians, turtles, invertebrates, *etc.*)\n\nThe phrase, toxic or adverse effect, also includes any adverse effects to humans (e.g., skin rashes) or domesticated animals that occur either from direct contact with or as a secondary effect from a discharge (e.g., sickness from consumption of plants or animals exposed to\n\n{107}------------------------------------------------\n\npesticides) to waters of the United States that are temporally and spatially related to exposure to a pesticide residue (e.g., vomiting, lethargy).\n\n**Annual Treatment Area Threshold** \u2013 an area (in acres) or linear distance (in miles) in a calendar year to which a Decision-maker is authorizing and/or performing pesticide applications in that area for activities covered under this permit.\n\nFor calculating annual treatment areas for Mosquitoes and Other Flying Insect Pest Control and Forest Canopy Pest for comparing with any threshold in Table 1-1, count each pesticide application activity to a treatment area (*i.e.*, that area where a pesticide application is intended to provide pesticidal benefits within the pest management area) as a separate area treated. For example, applying pesticides three times a year to the same 3,000 acre site should be counted as 9,000 acres of treatment area for purposes of determining if such an application exceeds an annual treatment area threshold. The treatment area for these two pesticide use patterns is additive over the calendar year.\n\nFor calculating annual treatment areas for Weed and Algae Control and Animal Pest Control for comparing with any threshold in Table 1-1, calculations should include either the linear extent of or the surface area of waters for applications made to waters of the United States or at water's edge adjacent to waters of the United States. For calculating the annual treatment area, count each treatment area only once, regardless of the number of pesticide application activities performed on that area in a given year. Also, for linear features (e.g., a canal or ditch), use the length of the linear feature whether treating in or adjacent to the feature, regardless of the number of applications made to that feature during the calendar year. For example, whether treating the bank on one side of a ten-mile long ditch, banks on both sides of the ditch, and/or water in that ditch, the total treatment area is ten miles for purposes of determining if an NOI is required to be submitted. Additionally, if the same 10 miles area is treated more than once in a calendar year, the total area treated is still 10 miles for purposes of comparing with any threshold in Table 1-1. The treatment area for these two pesticide use patterns is not additive over the calendar year.\n\n**Applicator** \u2013 any entity who performs the application of a pesticide or who has day-to-day control of the application (*i.e.*, they are authorized to direct workers to carry out those activities) that results in a discharge to waters of the United States.\n\n**Biological Control Agents** \u2013 these agents are organisms that can be introduced to Operator sites, such as herbivores, predators, parasites, and hyperparasites. [Source: FWS IPM Guidance, 2004]\n\n**Biological Pesticides (also called biopesticides)** \u2013 include microbial pesticides, biochemical pesticides and plant-incorporated protectants (PIP).

[40 CFR 158.2100(b)] Biochemical pesticide means a pesticide that (1) is a naturally-occurring substance or structurally-similar and functionally identical to a naturally-occurring substance; (2) has a history of exposure to humans and the environment demonstrating minimal toxicity, or in the case of a synthetically-derived biochemical pesticides, is equivalent to a naturally-occurring substance that has such a history;\n\n{108}------------------------------------------------\n\nand (3) Has a non-toxic mode of action to the target pest(s). [40 CFR 158.2000(a)(1)] Plant-incorporated protectant means a pesticidal substance that is intended to be produced and used in a living plant, or in the produce thereof, and the genetic material necessary for production of such a pesticidal substance. It also includes any inert ingredient contained in the plant or produce thereof. [40 CFR 174.3]\n\n**Chemical Pesticides** \u2013 all pesticides not otherwise classified as biological pesticides.\n\n**Cultural Methods** \u2013 manipulation of the habitat to increase pest mortality by making the habitat less suitable to the pest.\n\n**Decision-maker** \u2013 any entity with control over the decision to perform pesticide applications including the ability to modify those decisions that result in a discharge to waters of the United States.\n\n**Decision-maker Who is or Will be Required to Submit an NOI** \u2013 any Decision-maker covered under the PGP who knows or should have known that an NOI will be required for those discharges beginning on the effective date of the permit. Excluded from this definition are those activities for which an NOI is required based solely on that Decision-Maker exceeding an annual treatment area threshold.\n\n**Declared Pest Emergency Situation** \u2013 an event defined by a public declaration by a federal agency, state, or local government of a pest problem determined to require control through application of a pesticide beginning less than ten days after identification of the need for pest control. This public declaration may be based on:\n\n- (1) Significant risk to human health;\n- (2) Significant economic loss; or\n- (3) Significant risk to:\n  - (i) Endangered species,\n  - (ii) Threatened species,\n  - (iii) Beneficial organisms, or\n  - (iv) The environment.\n\n**Director** \u2013 a Regional Administrator of the EPA or an authorized representative. [Excerpted from 40 CFR 122.2]\n\n**Discharge** \u2013 when used without qualification, means the \u201cdischarge of a pollutant.\u201d [40 CFR 122.2]\n\n**Discharge of a Pollutant** \u2013 any addition of any \u201cpollutant\u201d or combination of pollutants to \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d from any \u201cpoint source,\u201d or any addition of any pollutant or combination of pollutants to the waters of the \u201ccontiguous zone\u201d or the ocean from any point source other than a vessel or other floating craft that is being used as a means of transportation. This definition includes additions of pollutants into waters of the United States from: surface runoff which is collected or channeled by human; discharges through pipes, sewers, or other conveyances leading into privately owned treatment works. [Excerpted from 40 CFR 122.2]\n\n{109}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Facility or Activity** \u2013 any NPDES \u201cpoint source\u201d or any other facility or activity (including land or appurtenances thereto) that is subject to regulation under the NPDES program. [40 CFR 122.2]\n\n**Federal Facility** \u2013 any buildings, installations, structures, land, public works, equipment, aircraft, vessels, and other vehicles and property, owned, operated, or leased by, or constructed or manufactured for the purpose of leasing to, the federal government.\n\n**For-Hire Applicator** \u2013 includes persons who make contractual pesticide applications for which they or their employer receives compensation (e.g., lawn care firms, pest control companies).\n\n**FWS Listed Resources of Concern** \u2013 Federally-listed threatened and endangered species and designated critical habitat listed under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) that are included in the FWS biological opinion for EPA\u2019s Pesticide General Permit.\n\n**Impaired Water** (or \u201cWater Quality Impaired Water\u201d or \u201cWater Quality Limited Segment\u201d) \u2013 a water is impaired for purposes of this permit if it has been identified by a state, Tribe or EPA pursuant to Section 303(d) of the CWA as not meeting applicable state or tribal water quality standards (these waters are called \u201cwater quality limited segments\u201d under 40 CFR 130.2(j)). Impaired waters include both waters with approved or established TMDLs, and those for which a TMDL has not yet been approved or established.\n\n**Indian Country** \u2013 (a) all land within the limits of any Indian reservation under the jurisdiction of the United States Government, notwithstanding the issuance of any patent, and including rights-of-way running through the reservation; (b) all dependent Indian communities within the borders of the United States, whether within the original or subsequently acquired territory thereof, and whether within or without the limits of a state, and (c) all Indian allotments, the Indian titles to which have not been extinguished, including rights-of-way running through the same. This definition includes all land held in trust for an Indian Tribe. [18 U.S.C. 1151; 40 CFR 122.2]\n\n**Inert Ingredient** \u2013 any substance (or group of structurally similar substances if designated by the Agency), other than an active ingredient, which is intentionally included in a pesticide product. [40 CFR 152.3] Inert ingredient also means any substance, such as a selectable marker, other than the active ingredient, where the substance is used to confirm or ensure the presence of the active ingredient, and includes the genetic material necessary for the production of the substance, provided that genetic material is intentionally introduced into a living plant in addition to the active ingredient. [40 CFR 174.3]\n\n**Lands of Exclusive Federal Jurisdiction** \u2013 all land where the Federal government has exclusive jurisdiction in relative respects.\n\n**Large Entity** \u2013 any entity that is not a \u201csmall entity.\u201d\n\n**Mechanical/Physical Methods** \u2013 mechanical tools or physical alterations of the environment, for pest prevention or removal.\n\n**Minimize** \u2013 to reduce and/or eliminate pesticide discharges to waters of the United States through the use of Pest Management Measures to the extent technologically available and economically practicable and achievable.\n\n{110}------------------------------------------------\n\n**NMFS Listed Resources of Concern** \u2013 ESA-listed species and designated critical habitat under the jurisdiction of National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) that are within, or adjacent to, and/or affected by discharges within, areas where EPA is the permitting authority as described in Appendix C of this permit.\n\n**Non-target Organisms** \u2013 includes the plant and animal hosts of the target species, the natural enemies of the target species living in the community, and other plants and animals, including vertebrates and invertebrates, living in or near the community that are not the target of the pesticide.\n\n**Operator** \u2013 for the purpose of this permit, any entity associated with the application of pesticides which results in a discharge to waters of the United States that meets either of the following two criteria:\n\n- (i) any entity who performs the application of a pesticide or who has day-to-day control of the application (*i.e.*, they are authorized to direct workers to carry out those activities); or\n- (ii) any entity with control over the decision to perform pesticide applications including the ability to modify those decisions.\n\n**Person** \u2013 an individual, association, partnership, corporation, municipality, state or federal agency, or an agent or employee thereof.\n\n**Pest** \u2013 Consistent with 40 CFR 152.5, any organism under circumstances that make it deleterious to man or the environment, if it is:\n\n- (a) Any vertebrate animal other than man;\n- (b) Any invertebrate animal, including but not limited to, any insect, other arthropod, nematode, or mollusk such as a slug and snail, but excluding any internal parasite of living man or other living animals;\n- (c) Any plant growing where not wanted, including any moss, alga, liverwort, or other plant of any higher order, and any plant part such as a root; or\n- (d) Any fungus, bacterium, virus, prion or other microorganism, except for those on or in living man or other living animals and those on or in processed food or processed animal feed, beverages, drugs (as defined in FFDCA sec. 201(g)(1)) and cosmetics (as defined in FFDCA sec. 201(i)).\n\n**Pest Management Area** \u2013 The area of land, including any water, for which an Operator has responsibility and is authorized to conduct pest management activities as covered by this permit (*e.g.*, for an Operator who is a mosquito control district, the pest management area is the total area of the district).\n\n**Pest Management Measure** \u2013 any practice used to meet the effluent limitations that complies with manufacturer specifications, industry standards and recommended industry practices related to the application of pesticides, relevant legal requirements, and other provisions that a prudent Operator would implement to reduce and/or eliminate pesticide discharges to waters of the United States.\n\n**Pesticide** \u2013 means (1) any substance or mixture of substances intended for preventing, destroying, repelling, or mitigating any pest, (2) any substance or mixture of substances intended\n\n{111}------------------------------------------------\n\nfor use as a plant regulator, defoliant, or desiccant, and (3) any nitrogen stabilizer, except that the term \u201cpesticide\u201d shall not include any article that is a \u201cnew animal drug\u201d within the meaning of section 201(w) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321(w)), that has been determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services not to be a new animal drug by a regulation establishing conditions of use for the article, or that is an animal feed within the meaning of section 201(x) of such Act (21 U.S.C. 321(x)) bearing or containing a new animal drug. The term \u201cpesticide\u201d does not include liquid chemical sterilant products (including any sterilant or subordinate disinfectant claims on such products) for use on a critical or semi-critical device as defined in section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321).

In some instances, the treatment area will be larger than the area where pesticides are actually applied. For example, the treatment area for a stationary drip treatment into a canal includes the entire width and length of the canal over which the pesticide is intended to control weeds. Similarly, the treatment area for a lake or marine area is the water surface area where the application is intended to provide pesticidal benefits.\n\n**Water Quality Impaired** \u2013 See \u2018Impaired Water.\u2019\n\n**Water Quality Standards** \u2013 A water quality standard defines the water quality goals of a water body, or portion thereof, by designating the use or uses to be made of the water and by setting criteria necessary to protect the uses. Water quality standards also include an antidegradation policy and implementation procedures. See *P.U.D. No. 1 of Jefferson County v. Wash. Dept. of Ecology*, 511 U.S. 700, 705 (1994). States, Tribes and EPA adopt water quality standards to protect public health or welfare, enhance the quality of water and serve the purposes of the CWA (See CWA sections 101(a)2 and 303(c)). Where necessary, EPA has the authority to promulgate federal water quality standards.\n\n**Wetlands** \u2013 means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. [40 CFR 122.2]\n\n{114}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **A.2.

Standard Permit Conditions\n\nAs provided by the introductory text of 40 CFR \u00a7122.41 and the regulation at 40 CFR \u00a7122.43(c), all of the standard permit conditions published in federal regulations at 40 CFR \u00a7122.41 are included below. [Note: Penalties for Violations of Permit Conditions: EPA and other federal agencies are required to adjust their maximum and minimum statutory civil penalty amounts through rulemaking by January 15 each year to account for inflation. EPA's annual rulemaking adjustments, codified in 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 19.4, are mandated by the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, as amended through the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvement Act of 2015 (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2461 note). As such, the civil penalty amounts below have changed and will likely change in the future due to inflation. See 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 19.4 for the most up-to-date civil penalty amounts.]\n\n40 CFR \u00a7 122.41 - Conditions applicable to all permits.\n\nThe following conditions apply to all NPDES permits. Additional conditions applicable to NPDES permits are in \u00a7122.42. All conditions applicable to NPDES permits shall be incorporated into the permits either expressly or by reference. If incorporated by reference, a specific citation to these regulations (or the corresponding approved State regulations) must be given in the permit.\n\n(a) *Duty to comply.* The permittee must comply with all conditions of this permit. Any permit noncompliance constitutes a violation of the Clean Water Act and is grounds for enforcement action; for permit termination, revocation and reissuance, or modification; or denial of a permit renewal application.\n\n(1) The permittee shall comply with effluent standards or prohibitions established under section 307(a) of the Clean Water Act for toxic pollutants and with standards for sewage sludge use or disposal established under section 405(d) of the CWA within the time provided in the regulations that establish these standards or prohibitions or standards for sewage sludge use or disposal, even if the permit has not yet been modified to incorporate the requirement.\n\n(2) The Clean Water Act provides that any person who violates section 301, 302, 306, 307, 308, 318 or 405 of the Act, or any permit condition or limitation implementing any such sections in a permit issued under section 402, or any requirement imposed in a pretreatment program approved under sections 402(a)(3) or 402(b)(8) of the Act, is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed \\$25,000 per day for each violation. [See 40 CFR 19.4 for the most up-to date civil penalty amounts.]\n\nThe Clean Water Act provides that any person who *negligently* violates sections 301, 302, 306, 307, 308, 318, or 405 of the Act, or any condition or limitation implementing any of such sections in a permit issued under section 402 of the Act, or any requirement imposed in a pretreatment program approved under section 402(a)(3) or 402(b)(8) of the Act, is subject to criminal penalties of \\$2,500 to \\$25,000 per day of violation, or imprisonment of not more than 1 year, or both. In the case of a second or subsequent conviction for a negligent violation, a person shall be subject to criminal penalties of not more than \\$50,000 per day of violation, or by\n\n{116}------------------------------------------------\n\nimprisonment of not more than 2 years, or both. Any person who *knowingly* violates such sections, or such conditions or limitations is subject to criminal penalties of \\$5,000 to \\$50,000 per day of violation, or imprisonment for not more than 3 years, or both. In the case of a second or subsequent conviction for a knowing violation, a person shall be subject to criminal penalties of not more than \\$100,000 per day of violation, or imprisonment of not more than 6 years, or both. Any person who knowingly violates section 301, 302, 303, 306, 307, 308, 318 or 405 of the Act, or any permit condition or limitation implementing any of such sections in a permit issued under section 402 of the Act, and who knows at that time that he thereby places another person in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury, shall, upon conviction, be subject to a fine of not more than \\$250,000 or imprisonment of not more than 15 years, or both. In the case of a second or subsequent conviction for a knowing endangerment violation, a person shall be subject to a fine of not more than \\$500,000 or by imprisonment of not more than 30 years, or both. An organization as defined in section 309(c)(3)(B)(iii) of the CWA shall, upon conviction of violating the imminent danger provision, be subject to a fine of not more than \\$1,000,000 and can be fined up to \\$2,000,000 for second or subsequent convictions. [See 40 CFR 19.4 for the most up-to date civil penalty amounts.]\n\n(3) Any person may be assessed an administrative penalty by the Administrator for violating section 301, 302, 306, 307, 308, 318 or 405 of this Act, or any permit condition or limitation implementing any of such sections in a permit issued under section 402 of this Act. Administrative penalties for Class I violations are not to exceed \\$10,000 per violation, with the maximum amount of any Class I penalty assessed not to exceed \\$25,000. Penalties for Class II violations are not to exceed \\$10,000 per day for each day during which the violation continues, with the maximum amount of any Class II penalty not to exceed \\$125,000. [See 40 CFR 19.4 for the most up-to-date civil penalty amounts]\n\n(b) *Duty to reapply.* If the permittee wishes to continue an activity regulated by this permit after the expiration date of this permit, the permittee must apply for and obtain a new permit.\n\n(c) *Need to halt or reduce activity not a defense.* It shall not be a defense for a permittee in an enforcement action that it would have been necessary to halt or reduce the permitted activity in order to maintain compliance with the conditions of this permit.\n\n(d) *Duty to mitigate.* The permittee shall take all reasonable steps to minimize or prevent any discharge or sludge use or disposal in violation of this permit which has a reasonable likelihood of adversely affecting human health or the environment.\n\n(e) *Proper operation and maintenance.* The permittee shall at all times properly operate and maintain all facilities and systems of treatment and control (and related appurtenances) which are installed or used by the permittee to achieve compliance with the conditions of this permit. Proper operation and maintenance also includes adequate laboratory controls and appropriate quality assurance procedures. This provision requires the operation of back-up or auxiliary facilities or similar systems which are installed by a permittee only when the operation is necessary to achieve compliance with the conditions of the permit.\n\n{117}------------------------------------------------\n\n(f) *Permit actions.* This permit may be modified, revoked and reissued, or terminated for cause. The filing of a request by the permittee for a permit modification, revocation and reissuance, or termination, or a notification of planned changes or anticipated noncompliance does not stay any permit condition.\n\n(g) *Property rights.* This permit does not convey any property rights of any sort, or any exclusive privilege.\n\n(h) *Duty to provide information.* The permittee shall furnish to the Director, within a reasonable time, any information which the Director may request to determine whether cause exists for modifying, revoking and reissuing, or terminating this permit or to determine compliance with this permit. The permittee shall also furnish to the Director upon request, copies of records required to be kept by this permit.\n\n(i) *Inspection and entry.* The permittee shall allow the Director, or an authorized representative (including an authorized contractor acting as a representative of the Administrator), upon presentation of credentials and other documents as may be required by law, to:\n\n(1) Enter upon the permittee's premises where a regulated facility or activity is located or conducted, or where records must be kept under the conditions of this permit;\n\n(2) Have access to and copy, at reasonable times, any records that must be kept under the conditions of this permit;\n\n(3) Inspect at reasonable times any facilities, equipment (including monitoring and control equipment), practices, or operations regulated or required under this permit; and\n\n(4) Sample or monitor at reasonable times, for the purposes of assuring permit compliance or as otherwise authorized by the Clean Water Act, any substances or parameters at any location.\n\n(j) *Monitoring and records.* (1) Samples and measurements taken for the purpose of monitoring shall be representative of the monitored activity.\n\n(2) Except for records of monitoring information required by this permit related to the permittee's sewage sludge use and disposal activities, which shall be retained for a period of at least five years (or longer as required by 40 CFR part 503), the permittee shall retain records of all monitoring information, including all calibration and maintenance records and all original strip chart recordings for continuous monitoring instrumentation, copies of all reports required by this permit, and records of all data used to complete the application for this permit, for a period of at least 3 years from the date of the sample, measurement, report or application. This period may be extended by request of the Director at any time.\n\n(3) Records of monitoring information shall include:\n\n(i) The date, exact place, and time of sampling or measurements;\n\n{118}------------------------------------------------\n\n- (ii) The individual(s) who performed the sampling or measurements;\n- (iii) The date(s) analyses were performed;\n- (iv) The individual(s) who performed the analyses;\n- (v) The analytical techniques or methods used; and\n- (vi) The results of such analyses.\n\n(4) Monitoring must be conducted according to test procedures approved under 40 CFR Part 136 unless another method is required under 40 CFR subchapters N or O.\n\n(5) The Clean Water Act provides that any person who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required to be maintained under this permit shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than \\$10,000, or by imprisonment for not more than 2 years, or both. If a conviction of a person is for a violation committed after a first conviction of such person under this paragraph, punishment is a fine of not more than \\$20,000 per day of violation, or by imprisonment of not more than 4 years, or both. [See 40 CFR 19.4 for the most up-to date civil penalty amounts.]\n\n(k) *Signatory requirement.* (1) All applications, reports, or information submitted to the Director shall be signed and certified. (See \u00a7122.22)\n\n(2) The CWA provides that any person who knowingly makes any false statement, representation, or certification in any record or other document submitted or required to be maintained under this permit, including monitoring reports or reports of compliance or non-compliance shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than \\$10,000 per violation, or by imprisonment for not more than 6 months per violation, or by both. [See 40 CFR 19.4 for the most up-to date civil penalty amounts.]\n\n(l) *Reporting requirements*\u2014(1) *Planned changes.* The permittee shall give notice to the Director as soon as possible of any planned physical alterations or additions to the permitted facility. Notice is required only when:\n\n(i) The alteration or addition to a permitted facility may meet one of the criteria for determining whether a facility is a new source in \u00a7122.29(b); or\n\n(ii) The alteration or addition could significantly change the nature or increase the quantity of pollutants discharged. This notification applies to pollutants which are subject neither to effluent limitations in the permit, nor to notification requirements under \u00a7122.42(a)(1).\n\n(iii) The alteration or addition results in a significant change in the permittee's sludge use or disposal practices, and such alteration, addition, or change may justify the application of permit conditions that are different from or absent in the existing permit, including notification of\n\n{119}------------------------------------------------\n\nadditional use or disposal sites not reported during the permit application process or not reported pursuant to an approved land application plan;\n\n(2) *Anticipated noncompliance.* The permittee shall give advance notice to the Director of any planned changes in the permitted facility or activity which may result in noncompliance with permit requirements.\n\n(3) *Transfers.* This permit is not transferable to any person except after notice to the Director. The Director may require modification or revocation and reissuance of the permit to change the name of the permittee and incorporate such other requirements as may be necessary under the Clean Water Act. (See \u00a7122.61; in some cases, modification or revocation and reissuance is mandatory.)\n\n(4) *Monitoring reports.* Monitoring results shall be reported at the intervals specified elsewhere in this permit.\n\n(i) Monitoring results must be reported on a Discharge Monitoring Report (DMR) or forms provided or specified by the Director for reporting results of monitoring of sludge use or disposal practices. As of December 21, 2016, all reports and forms submitted in compliance with this section must be submitted electronically by the permittee to the Director or initial recipient as defined in 40 CFR 127.2(b) in compliance with this section and 40 CFR Part 3 (including, in all cases, subpart D to Part 3), \u00a7122.22, and 40 CFR Part 127. Part 127 is not intended to undo existing requirements for electronic reporting. Prior to this date, and independent of Part 127, permittees may be required to report electronically if specified by a particular permit or if required to do so by state law.\n\n(ii) If the permittee monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the permit using test procedures approved under 40 CFR Part 136, or another method required for an industry-specific waste stream under 40 CFR subchapters N or O, the results of such monitoring shall be included in the calculation and reporting of the data submitted in the DMR or sludge reporting form specified by the (iii) Calculations for all limitations which require averaging of measurements shall utilize an arithmetic mean unless otherwise specified by the Director in the permit.\n\n(5) *Compliance schedules.* Reports of compliance or noncompliance with, or any progress reports on, interim and final requirements contained in any compliance schedule of this permit shall be submitted no later than 14 days following each schedule date.\n\n(6) *Twenty-four hour reporting.*\n\n(i) The permittee shall report any noncompliance which may endanger health or the environment. Any information shall be provided orally within 24 hours from the time the permittee becomes aware of the circumstances. A report shall also be provided within 5 days of the time the permittee becomes aware of the circumstances. The report shall contain a description of the noncompliance and its cause; the period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times), and if the noncompliance has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is\n\n{120}------------------------------------------------\n\nexpected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the noncompliance. For noncompliance events related to combined sewer overflows, sanitary sewer overflows, or bypass events, these reports must include the data described above (with the exception of time of discovery) as well as the type of event (combined sewer overflows, sanitary sewer overflows, or bypass events), type of sewer overflow structure (e.g., manhole, combine sewer overflow outfall), discharge volumes untreated by the treatment works treating domestic sewage, types of human health and environmental impacts of the sewer overflow event, and whether the noncompliance was related to wet weather. As of December 21, 2020, all reports related to combined sewer overflows, sanitary sewer overflows, or bypass events submitted in compliance with this section must be submitted electronically by the permittee to the Director or initial recipient as defined in 40 CFR 127.2(b) in compliance with this section and 40 CFR Part 3 (including, in all cases, subpart D to Part 3), \u00a7122.22, and 40 CFR Part 127. Part 127 is not intended to undo existing requirements for electronic reporting. Prior to this date, and independent of Part 127, permittees may be required to electronically submit reports related to combined sewer overflows, sanitary sewer overflows, or bypass events under this section by a particular permit or if required to do so by state law. The Director may also require permittees to electronically submit reports not related to combined sewer overflows, sanitary sewer overflows, or bypass events under this section.\n\n(ii) The following shall be included as information which must be reported within 24 hours under this paragraph.\n\n(A) Any unanticipated bypass which exceeds any effluent limitation in the permit. (See \u00a7122.41(g).)\n\n(B) Any upset which exceeds any effluent limitation in the permit.\n\n(C) Violation of a maximum daily discharge limitation for any of the pollutants listed by the Director in the permit to be reported within 24 hours. (See \u00a7122.44(g).)\n\n(iii) The Director may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis for reports under paragraph (l)(6)(ii) of this section if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.\n\n(7) *Other noncompliance.* The permittee shall report all instances of noncompliance not reported under paragraphs (l)(4), (5), and (6) of this section, at the time monitoring reports are submitted. The reports shall contain the information listed in paragraph (l)(6). For noncompliance events related to combined sewer overflows, sanitary sewer overflows, or bypass events, these reports shall contain the information described in paragraph (l)(6) and the applicable required data in appendix A to 40 CFR Part 127. As of December 21, 2020 all reports related to combined sewer overflows, sanitary sewer overflows, or bypass events submitted in compliance with this section must be submitted electronically by the permittee to the Director or initial recipient as defined in 40 CFR 127.2(b) in compliance with this section and 40 CFR Part 3 (including, in all cases, subpart D to Part 3), \u00a7122.22, and 40 CFR Part 127. Part 127 is not intended to undo existing requirements for electronic reporting. Prior to this date, and independent of Part 127, permittees may be required to electronically submit reports related to combined sewer overflows, sanitary sewer overflows, or bypass events under this section by a\n\n{121}------------------------------------------------\n\nparticular permit or if required to do so by state law. The Director may also require permittees to electronically submit reports not related to combined sewer overflows, sanitary sewer overflows, or bypass events under this section.\n\n(8) *Other information.* Where the permittee becomes aware that it failed to submit any relevant facts in a permit application or submitted incorrect information in a permit application or in any report to the Director, it shall promptly submit such facts or information.\n\n(9) *Identification of the initial recipient for NPDES electronic reporting data.* The owner, operator, or the duly authorized representative of an NPDES-regulated entity is required to electronically submit the required NPDES information (as specified in appendix A to 40 CFR Part 127) to the appropriate initial recipient, as determined by EPA, and as defined in \u00a7127.2(b) of this chapter. EPA will identify and publish the list of initial recipients on its Web site and in the FEDERAL REGISTER, by state and by NPDES data group [see \u00a7127.2(c) of this chapter]. EPA will update and maintain this listing.\n\n(m) *Bypass*\u2014(1) *Definitions.* (i) *Bypass* means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a treatment facility.\n\n(ii) *Severe property damage* means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.\n\n(2) *Bypass not exceeding limitations.* The permittee may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause effluent limitations to be exceeded, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of paragraphs (m)(3) and (m)(4) of this section.\n\n(3) *Notice*\u2014(i) *Anticipated bypass.* If the permittee knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice, if possible at least ten days before the date of the bypass. As of December 21, 2020 all notices submitted in compliance with this section must be submitted electronically by the permittee to the Director or initial recipient as defined in 40 CFR 127.2(b) in compliance with this section and 40 CFR Part 3 (including, in all cases, subpart D to Part 3), \u00a7122.22, and 40 CFR Part 127. Part 127 is not intended to undo existing requirements for electronic reporting. Prior to this date, and independent of Part 127, permittees may be required to report electronically if specified by a particular permit or if required to do so by state law.\n\n(ii) *Unanticipated bypass.* The permittee shall submit notice of an unanticipated bypass as required in paragraph (1)(6) of this section (24-hour notice). As of December 21, 2020 all notices submitted in compliance with this section must be submitted electronically by the permittee to the Director or initial recipient as defined in 40 CFR 127.2(b) in compliance with this section and 40 CFR Part 3 (including, in all cases, subpart D to Part 3), \u00a7122.22, and 40 CFR Part 127. Part 127 is not intended to undo existing requirements for electronic reporting. Prior to this date, and independent of Part 127, permittees may be required to report electronically if specified by a particular permit or if required to do so by state law.\n\n{122}------------------------------------------------\n\n(4) *Prohibition of bypass.* (i) Bypass is prohibited, and the Director may take enforcement action against a permittee for bypass, unless:\n\n(A) Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;\n\n(B) There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and\n\n(C) The permittee submitted notices as required under paragraph (m)(3) of this section.\n\n(ii) The Director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the Director determines that it will meet the three conditions listed above in paragraph (m)(4)(i) of this section.\n\n(n) *Upset*\u2014(1) *Definition.* *Upset* means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with technology based permit effluent limitations because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the permittee. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation.\n\n(2) *Effect of an upset.* An upset constitutes an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with such technology based permit effluent limitations if the requirements of paragraph (n)(3) of this section are met. No determination made during administrative review of claims that noncompliance was caused by upset, and before an action for noncompliance, is final administrative action subject to judicial review.\n\n(3) *Conditions necessary for a demonstration of upset.* A permittee who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:\n\n(i) An upset occurred and the permittee can identify the cause(s) of the upset;\n\n(ii) The permitted facility was at the time being properly operated; and\n\n(iii) The permittee submitted notice of the upset as required in paragraph (l)(6)(ii)(B) of this section (24 hour notice).\n\n(iv) The permittee complied with any remedial measures required under paragraph (d) of this section.\n\n{123}------------------------------------------------\n\n(4) *Burden of proof.* In any enforcement proceeding the permittee seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset has the burden of proof.\n\n{124}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Appendix C.

Endangered Species Protection: Complete Section D for each pest management area for which coverage under EPA's Pesticide General Permit is requested. Copy this section for additional pest management areas.**\n\nPest Management Area #\\_\\_\\_ of ##\\_\\_\\_\n\n1. Identify the criterion for which you are eligible for permit coverage as it applies to Federally-Listed Threatened or Endangered Species (i.e., Species) and/or Federally-Designated Critical Habitat (i.e., Habitat). A step-by-step guide for determining eligibility is provided in Appendix I of the PGP. Decision-makers are encouraged to use the Endangered Species Act (ESA) eligibility worksheet in Appendix I to help organize the information for preparing this NOI. To be eligible, Decision-makers must meet one of the six eligibility criteria (A-G) for the entire term of coverage under the permit and are required to provide the supporting documentation with the NOI. All criteria require submission with the NOI of a map with geospatial data using the EPA's geospatial mapping tool at <https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting-ESA-procedures> that includes the Project Action Area showing any overlap with FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern and generated within 90 days of NOI submittal. Check one:\n  - a.  Criterion A - Pesticide application activities will not result in a point source discharge to one or more waters of the United States or involve discharge-related activities that may expose Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) Listed Resources of Concern and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Listed Resources of Concern to pollutants. If this pesticide application is in response to a Declared Pest Emergency Situation, see Criterion G.  \nYou are required to provide a map with geospatial data of the Project Action Area, including the pest management area, and a list of FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern generated within 90 days of NOI submittal that show there are no FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern in the Project Action Area using the EPA geospatial mapping tool at <https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting-ESA-procedures>.\n  - b.  Criterion B - This Criterion intentionally left blank.\n  - c.  Criterion C - Pesticide application activities for which permit coverage is being requested will discharge to one or more waters of the United States and/or involve discharge-related activities that may expose FWS Listed Resources and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern to pollutants, but all \"take\" of these resources associated with such pesticide application activities has been authorized through FWS' and/or NMFS' issuance of a permit under Section 10 of the ESA, and such authorization addresses the effects of the pesticide discharges to waters of the United States and discharge-related activities on federally-listed species and federally-designated critical habitat based on a list of FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern generated within 90 days of NOI submittal. (The term \"take\" means to harass, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to attempt to engage in any such conduct. See Section 3 of the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1532 (19).)  \nYou are required to provide any tracking numbers of identifiers associated with the section 10 permit, the date the Section 10 permit was granted, whether the permit was granted by FWS and/or NMFS, the field office/regional office(s) granting the permit, the period of coverage provided by the permit, and a statement verifying that the Section 10 permit fully covers the proposed pesticide application activities in the Project Action Area. Attach additional pages as necessary. See Appendix I of the PGP for the worksheet to help organize the supporting documentation needed for Criterion C.\n  - d.  Criterion D - Pesticide application activities for which permit coverage is being requested will discharge to one or more receiving waters of the United States and/or involve discharge-related activities that may expose FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern to pollutants, but consultation with FWS and/or NMFS under Section 7 of the ESA has been concluded for pesticide application activities covered under the PGP. Consultations can be either formal or informal, and would have occurred only as a result of a separate federal action. The consultation addressed the effects of pesticide discharges to waters of the United States covered by the PGP and discharge-related activities on federally-listed threatened or endangered species and federally-designated critical habitat based on the list of FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern generated within 90 days of NOI submittal. The consultation must have resulted in either:\n    - i. A biological opinion from FWS and/or NMFS finding no jeopardy to federally-listed species and no destruction/adverse modification of federally-designated critical habitat and the Reasonable and Prudent Measures to minimize take have been or are in the process of being implemented in accordance with the biological opinion; or\n    - ii. Written concurrence from FWS and/or NMFS with a finding that the pesticide discharges to waters of the United States and discharge-related activities are not likely to adversely affect federally-listed species or federally-designated critical habitat.  \nYou are required to provide any tracking numbers of identifiers associated with the consultation (e.g., IPaC number, ECO number, ECOSphere codes), the Services field office/regional office(s) providing the consultation, any copies of supporting correspondence with FWS and/or NMFS, identification of the federal action agency(ies) involved, the date the consultation was completed, the period of coverage provided by the consultation, and a statement verifying that the consultation fully covers the proposed pesticide application activities in the Project Action Area. Attach additional pages as necessary. See Appendix I of the PGP for the worksheet to help organize the supporting documentation needed for Criterion D.\n  - e.  Criterion E - Pesticide application activities for which permit coverage is being requested in the NOI will discharge to one or more waters of the United States and/or involve discharge-related activities that may expose FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern to pollutants. Such discharges eligible under Criterion E are those where the Decision-maker includes in the NOI written correspondence from FWS and/or NMFS that pesticide application activities performed consistent with appropriate measures will avoid or eliminate the likelihood of any short- or long-term adverse effects to FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern.  \nYou are required to attach the written supporting correspondence from FWS and/or NMFS and a statement verifying that the coordination fully covers the proposed pesticide application activities in the Project Action Area. Eligibility under this criterion is contingent upon the Decision-maker following the measures described in correspondence from FWS and/or NMFS designed to avoid or eliminate the likelihood of any short- or long-term adverse effects. See Appendix I of the PGP for the worksheet to help identify the supporting documentation needed for Criterion E.\n  - f.  Criterion F - Pesticide application activities for which permit coverage is being requested in the NOI will discharge to one or more waters of the United States and/or involve discharge-related activities that may expose FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern to pollutants. Such discharges eligible under Criterion F are those from pesticide application activities that are demonstrated by the Decision-maker as not likely to result in any short- or long-term adverse effect to each FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern.  \nYou are required to provide the supporting documentation by completing question 2 below for each individual listed species and designate critical habitat. See Appendix I of the PGP for the worksheet to help organize the supporting documentation needed for Criterion F.\n  - g.  Criterion G - Pesticide application activities were, or will be, discharged to one or more waters of the United States and/or involve discharge-related activities in response to a Declared Pest Emergency Situation. To be eligible for coverage, Decision-makers must notify and coordinate with FWS and NMFS as soon as possible after determining that pesticide application is required in response to a Declared Pest Emergency Situation and prior to discharges.  \nYou are required to provide the supporting documentation by completing question 2 below *and providing a statement verifying the notification and coordination with FWS and/or NMFS.* See Appendix I of the PGP for the worksheet to help organize the supporting documentation needed for Criterion G.\n\n{132}------------------------------------------------\n\n2. If you checked Criterion F or Criterion G above, provide the following information for all discharges to waters of the United States and/or involve discharge-related activities that may expose FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern to pollutants, including all IPaC resource lists identified within the Project Action Area for the pest management area for which permit coverage is being requested. Provide information to demonstrate the basis for your finding for each individual listed species or designated critical habitat. For discharges pursuant to Criterion G, Declared Pest Emergency Situations, information for items a through g should also include any discharges that have already occurred prior to NOI submission as well as the activities you performed in the 15 or 30 day period before submission of this NOI was required. In some cases, implementation of Pest Management Measures as specified in the permit involves a degree of \"adaptive management\" such that exact timing and quantities of applications cannot be determined in advance for the duration of the permit. In such cases, the permittee must provide the required information to the extent feasible and consistent with the implementation of the selected Pest Management Measures. See Appendix I of the PGP for the worksheet to help organize the supporting documentation needed for Criterion F and Criterion G\n\n- Provide a map with geospatial data of the Project Action Area, including the pest management area, and a list generated within 90 days of NOI submittal that shows all FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern in the Project Action Area using the EPA's geospatial mapping tool at <https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting-ESA-procedures>.\n- Target Pest(s): \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n- Pesticide product(s) to be discharged and method of application: \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n- Planned quantity and rate of discharge(s) for each method of application: \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n- Number of planned discharges: \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n- Approximate date(s) of planned discharge(s): \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n- Your rationale supporting your determination for each individual listed species and designated critical habitat that you meet the criterion for which you are submitting this NOI. **For example, your determination may rely on the specific BMPs applied, visual monitoring, equipment and/or site inspections, and other appropriate measures that will be undertaken to avoid or eliminate the likelihood of any short- or long-term adverse effects to all FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern.** For certifications pursuant to Criterion G, indicate whether the discharge is likely to result in any short- or long-term adverse effect to FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern in response to a pest emergency and, if so, any feasible measures to avoid or eliminate such short- or long-term adverse effects; for example, it is not sufficient to state that \"integrated pest management procedures will be applied\" without describing the specific measures to be taken. Include a statement verifying your notification and coordination with FWS and NMFS. The notification must be in the form of an email that identifies the appropriate FWS, NMFS and EPA contact(s) and includes a description of the action, a map with geospatial data of the Project Action Area, and a list of FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern identified in the Project Action Area or a list from the EPA's geospatial mapping tool showing no FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern occur in the Project Action Area.

A copy of the permit is on EPA's website (<https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting>). The permit describes procedures to ensure your eligibility, prepare the ESA eligibility worksheet (Appendix I), prepare your Pesticide Discharge Management Plan (PDMP), and complete the NOI form questions\u2014all of which must be done before you sign the NOI certification statement attesting to the accuracy and completeness of your NOI. You will also need a copy of the permit once you have obtained coverage so that you can comply with the implementation requirements of the permit. Note: PDMP is not required for 1) any application made in response to a Declared Pest Emergency Situation, as defined in Appendix A of the permit; and 2) any Decision-maker who is required to submit an NOI solely because their application results in a point source discharge to waters of the United States that may expose FWS Listed Resources of Concern or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern to pollutants.\n\n**Approval to Use Paper NOI Form:** Note that you are not authorized to use this paper NOI form unless the EPA Regional Office has approved its use. Where you have obtained approval to use this form, indicate the waiver that you have been granted, the name of the EPA staff person who granted the waiver, and the date that approval was provided.\n\n**For any discharges after October 31, 2026:** Decision-makers meeting the eligibility requirements identified in the Part 1.1 of the permit and Table 1-1 must submit a complete and accurate NOI according to Table 1-2 and Table 1-3 and consistent with the requirements of Part 1.2 of the permit.

For assistance, contact EPA Regional offices and summarize the discussion, including description of the pest management area, and attached it to your NOI form.\n4. Enter the mailing address of the contact person for the pest management area. If this address is the same as the Decision-maker's mailing address, indicate that by checking the box. If it is a different address, enter the mailing address, telephone number, fax number (optional), contact name, and e-mail address.\n5. Indicate the pesticide use patterns for the pest management area for which the NOI is required. For additional information regarding pesticide use patterns, see Part 1.1.1 of the permit. Check all the use patterns that apply to the pest management area.\n6. Indicate if permit coverage is being requested for all waters of the United States within the pest management area or if permit coverage is being requested to specific waters of the United States within the pest management area. If specific waters are being requested, write the names of the waterbodies. If permit coverage is being requested for all waters of the United States within the pest management area except for specific waterbodies, name those specific waterbodies in the space provided. EPA's Water Locator Tool can help you identify the closest receiving water to your facility (<http://www.epa.gov/waterdata/waters-tools>).\n7. Indicate if permit coverage is being requested to discharge to a Tier 2, Tier 2.5 or Tier 3 (Outstanding National Resource Water) water of the United States. If the discharge is to a Tier 3 water of the United States, write the name(s) of the Tier 3 water(s) in the space provided. Describe and demonstrate why it is necessary to apply the pesticide discharge to protect the water quality, environment, and/or public health and that any such discharge will not degrade water quality or will degrade water quality only on a short-term or temporary basis. Attach the rationale to your NOI form.\n8. Verify that waters within the pest management area are either not impaired by substances which are either active ingredients in the pesticide planned for use or degradates of such active ingredients, OR that evidence shows that the target waters in question are no longer impaired. See Part 1.1.2.1 of the permit for more information on discharges to Water Quality Impaired Waters. Indicate if permit coverage is being requested to discharge to waters impaired for pesticide generally, group of pesticides, or active ingredients or degradate of such an active ingredient.\n\n##### Section D. Endangered Species Protection. Complete Section D for each pest management area for which coverage under EPA's PGP is desired.\n\nIdentify the pest management areas, corresponding to those in Part C.\n\n1. Coverage under the permit is available only for discharges to waters of the United States and discharge-related activities that are not likely to result in any short- or long-term adverse effects to any species that are federally-listed as endangered or threatened (\"listed\") under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and not likely to result in any short- or long-term adverse modification or destruction of habitat that is federally-designated as critical under the ESA (\"critical habitat\") except as provided in Criterion C, D, and for at least 60 days, G, below. For FWS Listed Resources of Concern or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern as defined in Appendix A of the PGP, there are specific criteria for determining eligibility. To demonstrate eligibility, you must meet one or more of the six eligibility criteria (A-G) for the entire term of coverage under the permit and provide supporting documentation. A step-by-step guide with a worksheet for determining eligibility is provided in Appendix I of the PGP. If you received a waiver to file a paper NOI, you must submit a copy of the map and list of all FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern generated through the EPA's geospatial mapping tool for your Project Action Area and your worksheet (Appendix I) with your paper NOI.\n\n2. You must provide a map with geospatial data of the Project Action Area, including the pest management area, using the tools at <https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting-ESA-procedures>. Evaluation of the pest management area must include a list showing any overlap with federally-listed species and/or designated critical habitats generated within 90 days of seeking permit coverage.\n\n{136}------------------------------------------------\n\n3. If you checked Criterion F or Criterion G, you are required to provide the target pest(s), pesticide product(s) to be discharged and method of application, planned quantity and rate of discharge(s) for each application method, number of planned discharges, approximate date(s) of planned discharge(s), and the rationale supporting your determination that you meet the criterion for which the Decision-maker is submitting this NOI and documentation demonstrating the finding of \"not likely to result in any short- or long-term adverse effects\" for each FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern identified in your Project Action Area. If you certify under Criterion F and do not hear from EPA within 30 days, you may assume your discharge is authorized. For certifications pursuant to Criterion G, indicate whether the discharge is likely to result in any short- or long-term adverse effects to FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern and, if so, any feasible measures to avoid or eliminate such adverse effects. If you are certifying under Criterion G (which allows you to discharge 15 or 30 days before you even submit your NOI after notification and coordination with the FWS and NMFS), your NOI should describe both the pest emergency activities you plan to do after you submit your NOI as well as the activities you performed in that 15 or 30 day period before you had to submit the NOI. See Part 1.1.2.4 and Appendix I of the PGP for more information regarding Endangered and Threatened Species and Critical Habitat Protection.\n\n4. If your discharge is in response to a Declared Pest Emergency Situation, prior to any discharge to waters of the United States and discharge-related activities under Criterion G, Decision-makers must notify and coordinate with FWS and NMFS to be eligible for coverage. Notification shall occur and coordination shall begin as soon as possible after determining that pesticide application is required in response to a Declared Pest Emergency Situation. The notification must be in the form of an email that identifies the appropriate FWS, NMFS and EPA contact(s) and include a description of the action, the pest management area and Project Action Area map, and a list of FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern identified in the Project Action Area or the list from EPA's geospatial mapping tool showing no FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern occur in the Project Action Area.\n\n5. EPA may authorize certain discharges in less than 30 days, but no fewer than 10 days, for any discharges authorized under Criterion C, D, or E (for which FWS and/or NMFS has already evaluated the effects of these discharges). If you certify under one of these criteria and do not hear from EPA within 30 days, you may assume your discharge is authorized.\n\n##### **Section E. Attachments**\n\nIndicate attachments you are submitting with your NOI in this section. If you are attaching a document that is not listed, indicate other and provide a description of the document.\n\n##### **Section F. Certification**\n\nEnter the certifier's printed name and title.

However, if EPA notifies the Operator to apply for an NPDES individual permit or alternative general permit, coverage under this permit terminates automatically. Dischargers automatically covered under this permit as identified in Part 1.2.3 of the permit are likewise automatically terminated upon permanent cessation of discharge consistent with any of the criteria identified in Part 1.2.5.3 of the permit. As required in the permit, only certain Operators who are also Decision-makers must submit NOIs. Note: NOIs submitted under the 2021 PGP are **automatically** terminated at 11:59 p.m. on October 30, 2026. Decision-maker who are required to submit an NOI must submit a new NOI to obtain coverage under the 2026 PGP.\n\nIf you have questions about whether you need to file an NOT or questions about completing the form, see <https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting> or contact the NPDES eReporting help desk at (877) 227-8965 or Email at [NPDESeReporting@epa.gov](mailto:NPDESeReporting@epa.gov).\n\n##### When to File the NOT?\n\nOperators must file the NOT form within 30 days after one or more of the conditions in Part 1.2.5.2 of the permit have been met.\n\n**Approval to Use Paper NOT Form:** Note that you are not authorized to use this paper NOT form unless the EPA Regional Office has approved its use.

Thus, a pest management area can have one or more treatment areas. Operators required to retain the information contained on this worksheet must do so for each treatment area. For treatment areas with the same or similar pests, the Operator can use one worksheet to document pest management activities for those multiple treatment areas.\n\n##### When to Complete a PDEW?\n\nBefore any pesticide application, any Operator using this form to meet its obligations under the PGP must complete Section B of this worksheet. Section C, except for the pesticide application end date and total quantity of pesticide applied, must be completed as soon as possible but no later than 14 days after the first pesticide application. The total quantity of pesticide applied and the pesticide application end date must be completed as soon as possible but no later than 14 days after completion of pesticide application for this project.\n\nAny Operator using this form to meet its obligations under the PGP must retain this worksheet for at least 3 years from the date that coverage is granted under the PGP or when the permit expires or is terminated. These Operators must make this worksheet available to EPA, including an authorized representative of EPA, upon request.\n\n##### Completing the PDEW\n\nTo complete this form, type or print in uppercase letters in the appropriate areas only. Make sure you complete all questions.\n\n##### Section A. General Information\n\n1. Enter the Operator's full legal name and the existing NPDES Permit Tracking Number assigned by EPA's NPDES eReporting Tool (Net) or EPA's Pesticides Processing Center. You can find the tracking number assigned to your previous NOI using EPA's Net.\n2. Enter the full legal name of the person completing the form.\n3. Section A should be completed for each pest management area. Indicate which pest management area out of the total number of pest management areas for which the section is being completed (i.e., Pest Management Area 1 of 10 total Pest Management Areas).\n4. Enter the name of the pest management area.\n5. Identify the pesticide use pattern(s) for the pest management area.\n6. For each treatment area, provide a brief description and location description of the treatment area within the pest management area; size of the treatment area in acres or linear feet, and name or location of any waters of the United States to which discharges occur.\n\n##### Section B. Pest Evaluation\n\n1. Identify the target pest(s) and provide a brief description of why pest control is needed.\n2. Provide a brief description of any Pest Management Measure(s) implemented before pesticide application. For example, identify if you have performed physical control techniques such as pulling weeds, removing breeding habitat, or trapping animals.\n\n##### Section C. Pesticide Application\n\n1. Provide the company name and contact information of the pesticide Applicator.\n2. Enter the date that the pesticide application began and ended.\n3. Enter the name of each pesticide product used including the EPA Pesticide Registration Number, the quantity of pesticide applied, and the method used to apply the pesticide (e.g., fixed wing aircraft, backpack sprayer).\n4. Indicate if visual monitoring was conducted during the pesticide application and/or post-application. If visual monitoring was conducted, the record must include the date, time, and location where visual monitoring was conducted. If visual monitoring was not performed, provide a brief description of why visual monitoring was not conducted.\n5. Indicate if there were any adverse effects identified during visual monitoring. Provide a brief description of any adverse effects that were identified.\n\n##### Section D. Certification\n\nEnter the certifier's printed name and title. Sign and date the form. For more information about the certification statement and signature, see 40 CFR 122.41(k). (CAUTION: An unsigned or undated form will not be accepted.) Federal statutes provide for severe penalties for submitting false information. Federal regulations require this application to be signed as follows:\n\n*For a corporation:* by a responsible corporate officer, means:\n\n- (i) president, secretary, treasurer, or vice-president of the corporation in charge of a principal business function, or any other person who performs similar policy or decision-making functions for the corporation, or\n- (ii) the manager of one or more manufacturing, production, or operating facilities, provided the manager is authorized to make management decisions that govern the operation of the regulated activity including having the explicit or implicit duty of making major capital investment recommendations, and initiating and directing other comprehensive measures to assure long-term environmental compliance with environmental laws and regulations; the manager can ensure that the necessary systems are established or actions taken to gather complete and accurate information for permit application requirements; and where authority to sign documents has been assigned or delegated to the manager in accordance with corporate procedures;\n\n*For a partnership or sole proprietorship:* by a general partner or the proprietor; or\n\n*For a municipal, state, federal, or other public facility:* by either a principal executive or ranking elected official.\n\nIf the PDEW was prepared by someone other than the certifier (for example, if the PDEW was prepared by a consultant for the certifier's signature), include the name, organization, phone number and e-mail address of the PDEW preparer.\n\n##### Paperwork Reduction Act Notice\n\nThe public reporting and recordkeeping burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 1 hour or 60 minutes per response.\n\nSend comments on the Agency's need for this information, the accuracy of the provided burden estimates, and any suggested methods for minimizing respondent burden, including through the use of automated collection techniques to the Director, Collection Strategies Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (2822T), 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW, Washington, D.C. 20460.

This information may be useful to support a rationale should this determination be questioned.\n\nAn adverse incident, as defined in the Appendix A of the permit, is an unusual or unexpected incident that an Operator has observed upon inspection or of which the Operator otherwise became aware, in which: (1) there is evidence that a person or non-target organism has likely been exposed to a pesticide residue, and (2) the person or non-target organism suffered a toxic or adverse effect. See Appendix A of the permit, for the complete definition of adverse incident.\n\nWhere multiple Operators are authorized for a discharge that results in an adverse incident, notification and reporting by any one of the Operators constitutes compliance for all of the Operators, provided a copy of the written report required in Part 6.4.2 of the permit is also provided to all of the other authorized Operators within 30 days of the reportable adverse incident.\n\n##### When to File the Adverse Incident Report\n\nOperators must provide a written report of any reportable adverse incidents to the appropriate EPA Regional office and to the state lead agency for pesticide regulation within 30 days of the adverse incident pursuant to Part 6.4.1.1 of the permit.\n\n##### Where to File the 30-day Adverse Incident Report\n\nThe Operator must immediately notify the appropriate EPA Incident Reporting Contact, as identified at <https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting>, of the adverse incident within 24 hours. The Operator(s) must provide a written report of the adverse incident to the appropriate EPA Regional office at the address listed in Part 8 of the permit and to the state lead agency for pesticide regulation (see <http://npic.orst.edu/state1.htm>).\n\nIf an Operator becomes aware of an adverse incident affecting a federally-listed threatened or endangered species or federally-designated critical habitats which may have resulted from a discharge from the Operator's pesticide application, the Operator must immediately notify the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) in the case of an anadromous or marine species, (see <http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov>) or the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) in the case of a terrestrial or freshwater species (see <https://www.fws.gov/program/office-of-law-enforcement/contact-us>).\n\n#### Completing the 30-day Adverse Incident Report\n\nTo complete this form, type or print in uppercase letters in the appropriate areas only. Please make sure you complete all questions. Make sure you make a photocopy for your records before you send the completed original form to the appropriate EPA Regional office.\n\n##### Section A. Reportable Adverse Incident\n\nThe Operator is required to submit this Adverse Incident Report if the adverse incident is reportable. Check yes if the adverse incident is reportable. If an Adverse Incident Report is not required, check no. No further action is needed on this form. Reporting of adverse incidents is not required under the PGP in the following situations:\n\n- An Operator is aware of facts that indicate that the adverse incident was not related to toxic effects or exposure from the pesticide application;\n- An Operator has been notified by EPA, and retains such notification, that the reporting requirement has been waived for this incident or category of incidents;\n- An Operator receives information notifying the Operator of an adverse incident, but that information is clearly erroneous; or\n- An adverse incident occurs to pests that are similar in kind to potential target pests identified on the FIFRA label except as required in Part 6.4.3, Notification of Adverse Incident to Threatened or Endangered Species or Critical Habitat.\n\n##### Section B. Information from the 24-hour Adverse Incident Notification and Notification for Adverse Incident to Threatened or Endangered Species or Critical Habitat\n\n- Provide contact information for the person who called EPA to report the adverse incident.\n  - Enter the legal name of the caller.\n  - Enter the phone number of the caller.\n- Provide the Operator's contact information.\n  - Enter the legal name of the Operator.\n  - Enter the mailing address of the Operator.\n- If an NOI was filed as required in Part 1.2 of the permit, enter the NPDES Permit Tracking Number assigned by NeT or the EPA's Pesticides Processing Center. You can find the tracking number assigned to your NOI using EPA's NPDES eReporting Tool (NeT). If no NOI submitted, enter \"NA\" for not applicable.\n- Provide information for a contact person, if different than the person who called EPA to report the adverse incident.\n  - Enter the legal name of the contact person.\n  - Enter the phone number of the contact person.\n- Provide a description of how and when the Operator became aware of the adverse incident.\n- Provide a description of the location of the adverse incident.\n- Provide a description of the adverse incident, including any non-target organisms affected and signs of adverse effects, and the pesticide product used in the adverse incident. Include the EPA pesticide registration number for each product applied in the area of the adverse incident. Attach additional pages if necessary.\n- Provide a description of any steps the Operator has taken to correct, repair, remedy, clean up or otherwise address the adverse effects of the incident.\n- Identify any other Operators authorized for coverage under the permit for discharges from the pesticide application activities that resulted in the adverse incident. If other Operators are authorized under this permit, provide details of your notification of those other Operator(s).\n\n##### Section C. Date and Time the Operator Notified EPA of the Adverse Incident\n\n- Enter the date that EPA was contacted to report the adverse incident.\n- Enter the time EPA was contacted to report the adverse incident.\n- Provide the legal name and title of the person contacted at EPA.\n- Provide a description of the instructions received by EPA.\n\n##### Section D. Other Information Required in the Thirty (30) Day Adverse Incident Report\n\n- Enter the location of the adverse incident and include the names of any waters affected.

Do not send the completed Adverse Incident Report to this address.\n\n{158}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Appendix I.PGP Eligibility Worksheet for Threatened and Endangered Species Protection\n\nAll pesticide applications covered by this permit require a Decision-maker who is responsible for ensuring eligibility under the PGP and submitting a Notice of Intent (NOI) when species and/or designated critical habitat under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) may be exposed to pollutants associated with their discharges and discharge-related activities. Step 1 of this worksheet is to help Decision-makers determine whether ESA-listed species and/or designated critical habitat (Listed Resources of Concern) may be exposed to pollutants in the Project Action Area(s) as a result of pesticide applications made to the pest management area(s).\n\nThis worksheet replicates information required for determining ESA eligibility when completing an NOI electronically for coverage under the PGP. It can be used to help a Decision-maker gather the ESA eligibility information needed for NOI submission. It can also be completed by Operators not otherwise required to submit an NOI, to confirm and document that an NOI and annual reporting is not required because FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern are not present in the Project Action Area(s). EPA's geospatial mapping tool at <https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting-ESA-procedures> must be used to determine whether ESA-listed species and/or designated critical habitat (Listed Resources of Concern) may be exposed to pollutants in the Project Action Area(s) as a result of pesticide applications made to the pest management area(s).\n\n### Elements of the Worksheet\n\n- I.1 Introduction\n- I.2 Notice of Intent (NOI) Submittal and Review\n- I.3 Worksheet\n  - Step 1 Determine if FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern are Present in the Project Action Area\n  - Step 2 Determine if You Meet the Eligibility Requirements of Criterion B\n  - Step 3 Determine if You Meet the Eligibility Requirement of Criterion C or Criterion D\n  - Step 4 Determine if Measures Can Be Implemented to Avoid Adverse Effects\n  - Step 5 Determine if You Meet the Eligibility Requirements of Criterion F\n  - Step 6 Determine if the Pesticide Application is in Response to a Declared Pest Emergency Situation\n\n{159}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Appendix I \u2013 PGP Eligibility Worksheet for Threatened and Endangered Species ProtectionI.1 Introduction\n\nDecision-makers must meet one of the following six ESA eligibility criteria (A or C-G) in Part 1.1.2.4 of the PGP for the entire term of coverage under the 2026 PGP. The ESA eligibility criteria are briefly summarized below.\n\n**Criterion A** \u2013 No FWS and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern present in the Project Action Area.\n\n**Criterion B** \u2013 Placeholder Criterion, and not applicable for PGP.\n\n**Criterion C** \u2013 Discharge effects are addressed under an ESA Section 10 permit.\n\n**Criterion D** \u2013 Discharge effects are addressed under an ESA Section 7 consultation that has concluded.\n\n**Criterion E** \u2013 Discharge effects are addressed through coordination with the Services.\n\n**Criterion F** \u2013 Discharge effects are addressed and not likely to result in any short- or long-term adverse effects to FWS and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern.\n\n**Criterion G** \u2013 Declared Pest Emergency Situation\n\nIf you do not meet any of the ESA eligibility criteria outlined in this worksheet, you are not eligible for coverage under this permit.<sup>2</sup>\n\n#### **Relevant Definitions**\n\n**FWS Listed Resources of Concern** \u2013 Federally-listed threatened and endangered species and designated critical habitat listed under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) that are included in FWS biological opinion for EPA\u2019s Pesticide General Permit.\n\n**NMFS Listed Resources of Concern** \u2013 ESA-listed species and designated critical habitat under the jurisdiction of National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) that are within, or adjacent to, and/or affected by discharges within, areas where EPA is the permitting authority, as described in Appendix C of this permit.\n\n**Project Action Area** - all areas to be affected directly or indirectly by the Operator\u2019s discharge(s) to waters of the U.S. covered by the PGP and discharge-related activities in the Operator\u2019s pest management area(s).\n\n**Pest Management Area** -- The area of land, including any water, for which an Operator has responsibility and is authorized to conduct pest management activities as covered by this permit (e.g., for an Operator who is a mosquito control district, the pest management area is the total area of the district).\n\n<sup>2</sup> To explore alternative NPDES permit coverage, contact your EPA Regional office: <https://www.epa.gov/npdes/contact-us-pesticide-permitting>.\n\n{160}------------------------------------------------\n\nIt is important to accurately determine ESA eligibility when seeking permit coverage because Section 9 of the ESA and, in some cases, regulations issued for threatened species pursuant to Section 4(d) of the ESA, prohibit the take<sup>3</sup> of endangered and threatened species, respectively, without an applicable exemption. ESA Section 9 violations can result in civil and even criminal penalties.\n\n**Step 1, described in this worksheet, is necessary for determining eligibility.** Step 1 identifies any FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern that would potentially be exposed to pollutants in the Project Action Area from proposed pesticide applications based on NMFS and FWS authoritative data or data approved by the Services (e.g., an official resource list based on data from IPaC for FWS Listed Resources of Concern). In Step 1, the Decision-maker delineates the Project Action Area affected directly or indirectly by the proposed discharge(s) to the pest management area and obtains a map with a list of potentially exposed ESA-listed species and designated critical habitat using EPA's geospatial mapping tool (<https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting-esa-procedures>)<sup>4</sup>. **The map and the list obtained in Step 1 must be generated within 90 days of seeking permit coverage and submitted with the NOI**<sup>5</sup> if the Decision-maker is required to submit an NOI. If you received a waiver to file your NOI electronically, you must submit a copy of the list generated through the geospatial mapping tool with your paper NOI.\n\n**If FWS and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern are in your Project Action Area,** you must identify and evaluate potential short- or long-term adverse effects of your discharges and discharge-related activities on both FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern<sup>6</sup> in the Project Action Area and identify whether and how effects are or will be addressed in order to select the correct ESA eligibility Criterion. You must comply with any applicable terms, conditions, or other requirements developed in meeting one of the eligibility criteria (e.g., avoidance measures) to remain eligible for coverage under this permit.\n\nIf your pest management area overlaps with any water where NMFS' Listed Resources of Concern occur and you expect discharges from the application of pesticides that have a labeled use that a NMFS' biological opinion has determined would jeopardize the continued existence of ESA-listed species and/or adversely modify designated critical habitat, it is in your best interest to contact your regional NMFS office or the Office of Protected Resources in Silver Spring, Maryland and request \"technical assistance on potential pesticide applications from an ESA Section 7 biologist.\" Check the [NMFS Consultation page](#) for the most up to date information on pesticides that have a labeled use that a NMFS' biological opinion has determined would jeopardize the continued existence of ESA-listed species and/or adversely modify designated\n\n---\n\n<sup>3</sup> The term \"take\" means to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to attempt to engage in any such conduct. See 16 U.S. Code \u00a7 1532 (19).\n\n<sup>4</sup> If EPA's geospatial mapping tool is not available, Decision-makers must use IPaC for FWS resource lists and NMFS' mappers. Links to these tools are available at <https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting-esa-procedures>.\n\n<sup>5</sup> Ideally, once complete, the EPA's geospatial mapping tool will be integrated into the NPDES eReporting Tool (NeT) and will automatically transmit map and list of ESA-protected species and/or designated critical habitat into your NOI.\n\n<sup>6</sup> NMFS' jurisdiction includes ESA-listed marine and estuarine species that spawn in inland rivers.\n\n{161}------------------------------------------------\n\ncritical habitat. Links to all NMFS pesticide registration opinions are provided on this page. The opinions include reasonable and prudent measures and actions to minimize exposure and/or adverse effects to ESA-listed species and critical habitat that may be exposed. A Decision-maker may wish to consider these measures and actions when developing the Pesticide Pollutant Discharge Management Plan.\n\nIf your Project Action Area overlaps with areas where FWS' Listed Resources of Concern occur for the pesticides covered under EPA's PGP, see <https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting-esa-procedures> for more information.\n\n### I.2 Notice of Intent (NOI) Submittal and Review\n\nIf your discharge to waters of the U.S. and discharge-related activities may expose ESA-listed species to pollutants and you meet any of the eligibility criteria C through G, you must submit an NOI for coverage under the permit. If you can accurately confirm and document that your discharge and discharge-related activities will not expose ESA-listed species to pollutants, you will only be required to submit an NOI if you are otherwise required to submit an NOI as indicated in Table 1-1 of the PGP. In such cases, when you submit your NOI, you identify that ESA eligibility Criterion A applies to your proposed discharge.\n\nAfter you submit your NOI and before your NOI is authorized, EPA may notify you of any additional controls that are necessary to ensure your discharges to waters of United States and discharge-related activities are not likely to result in any short- or long-term adverse effects on FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern. The Services have the opportunity, within 30 days of submission of the NOI, to advise EPA whether either the planned discharges meet the selected eligibility criterion; the planned discharges could meet the eligibility criterion with additional conditions; or the planned discharges do not meet the eligibility criterion. In the event that EPA has placed a hold on your NOI, EPA will notify you as to whether your discharges are authorized or whether an NPDES individual permit will be required. If you do not hear from EPA within 30 days, you may assume that your discharge is authorized without further conditions. Authorization will remain in effect unless and until notified by EPA that activities identified in the NOI will be reevaluated. If the discharges are in response to a Declared Pest Emergency Situation, you must follow the notification and coordination procedures with the Services prior to discharges, followed by NOI submittal, under Criterion G. Note, if you make changes to your proposed discharges to waters of the United States or discharge-related activities as outlined in Table 1-3 of the permit, then you must reevaluate and update your NOI (if necessary).\n\n{162}------------------------------------------------\n\n### I.3 Worksheet\n\nFollow the instructions below to determine if you are eligible for coverage under the 2026 PGP based on the ESA eligibility criteria in Part 1.1.2.4. of the permit. **Check only one criterion per pest management area and record the required information in your NOI, if applicable.** You may submit one NOI for multiple pest management areas within a state or territory for which you are seeking permit coverage. Complete the worksheet for each pest management area. **Each pest management area can be assigned only one ESA Eligibility Criterion and information supporting the selected criterion must be recorded in, or submitted with, your NOI.** Copy this worksheet for additional pest management areas.\n\nPest Management Area: \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ of \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nPest Management Area Name: \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Before proceeding with ESA eligibility criteria selection, you must consider the following in determining the Project Action Area, and confirm the following are true:**\n\nIn determining my Project Action Area, I have identified and included all receiving waterbodies and adjacent lands that could receive pollutants from my discharges to waters of United States and discharge-related activities within the pest management area.\n\n**Note:** If you have any questions about determining the extent of your Project Action Area, you may contact EPA or the Services for assistance. Contact information is available at: <https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting-ESA-procedures>.\n\n#### Step 1 \u2013 Determine if FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern are Present in the Project Action Area\n\nFirst, you must determine whether there are FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern present within your Project Action Area using EPA\u2019s geospatial mapping tool at <https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting-ESA-procedures>. The tool will provide a resource list and map identifying whether, where, and which FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern may be present in your Project Action Area. If FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern are not present in the Project Action Area, the output from the geospatial mapping tool will not list any species or designated critical habitat.\n\n{163}------------------------------------------------\n\n##### ESA Eligibility Criterion A Requirements\n\nTo determine eligibility for coverage under Criterion A, you must use EPA's geospatial mapping tool. One of the following \"**I have confirmed**\" statements below **must be true** (check the appropriate boxes):\n\n- I confirm that I have used EPA's geospatial mapping tool and my ESA eligibility determination is based on output generated by the tool within 90 days of seeking permit coverage to determine whether any FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern are within my Project Action Area. I have confirmed there are FWS Listed Resources of Concern **or** that there are NMFS Listed Resources of Concern **affected directly or indirectly** in my Project Action Area; (check all that apply and **proceed to Step 3 OR** If your pesticide application is in response to a Declared Pest Emergency Situation, **proceed to Step 6, Criterion G**)\n  - FWS Listed Resources of Concern\n  - NMFS Listed Resources of Concern\n- I confirm that I have used EPA's geospatial mapping tool and my ESA eligibility determination is based on output generated by the tool within 90 days of seeking permit coverage to determine whether any FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern are within my Project Action Area. I have confirmed there are **no** FWS Listed Resources of Concern **and** that there are **no** NMFS Listed Resources of Concern **affected directly or indirectly** in my Project Action Area. If this pesticide application is in response to a Declared Pest Emergency Situation **proceed to Step 6, Criterion G**.\n  - NO** FWS Listed Resources of Concern **AND**\n  - NO** NMFS Listed Resources of Concern\n\nYou can certify that the activity meets Criterion A (check box on the NOI corresponding to Criterion A and submit the supporting documentation (e.g. map with geospatial data that includes the Project Action Area and the list generated through the geospatial mapping tool with no FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern) with the NOI).\n\nNote that if you are not otherwise required to submit an NOI, you do not need to submit an NOI merely to document that you meet eligibility Criterion A. However, if you are required to submit an NOI anyway, you must document on the NOI that you meet eligibility Criterion A. **If you received a waiver to file a paper NOI, you must submit a copy of the map and list generated through the geospatial mapping tool in Step 1 and your worksheet with your paper NOI.**\n\n{164}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Step 2 \u2013 Determine if You Meet the Eligibility Requirements of Criterion B\n\n##### ESA Eligibility Criterion B Requirements\n\nThis criterion intentionally left blank. Proceed to Step 3.\n\n#### Step 3 \u2013 Determine if You Meet the Eligibility Requirement of Criterion C or Criterion D\n\n##### ESA Eligibility Criterion C Requirements\n\nIf you have previously been issued an ESA Section 10(a)(1) permit(s) that fully covers the effects of your proposed discharges to waters of the United States and discharge-related activities on all FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern identified in your Project Action Area (based on the resource lists generated in Step 1 within 90 days of NOI submittal), then your proposed activity may be eligible for coverage under Criterion C.\n\nIf you believe an existing ESA-related action may have already been completed for your planned discharges to waters of the United States or discharge-related activities but you are uncertain of the details, you should contact the FWS office and/or NMFS office(s) that covers your Project Action Area (contact information is available at <https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting-ESA-procedures>).\n\n**In order to be eligible for coverage under Criterion C, the following statement must be true for species under the jurisdiction of each Service, as applicable:**\n\nI have confirmed in Step 1 that there are FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern in my Project Action Area.\n\nI can confirm that I have a permit or permits issued under Section 10 of the ESA that specifically addresses the effects of my discharges to waters of the United States and discharge-related activities on all FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern **affected directly or indirectly** in my Project Action Area.\n\n**Issuance of ESA Section 10 permit.** Potential take is authorized through the issuance of a permit under Section 10 of the ESA by the FWS and/or NMFS, as necessary, and this authorization addresses the effects of the discharges to waters of the United States and discharge-related activities on FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern present in the Project Action Area.\n\n**C1.** I confirm that both FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern were considered in my evaluation and that I have used the EPA's geospatial mapping tool as outlined in Step 1. I am providing the map and the list of all FWS Listed\n\n{165}------------------------------------------------\n\nResources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern from the geospatial mapping tool in Step 1. Yes\n\nC2. Which Service provided the Section 10 permit? (check all that apply)\n\nFWS  NMFS\n\nC3. Identify the field or regional offices providing the permit(s):\n\nC4. Identify the permit number and other tracking numbers associated with the ESA Section 10 permit (e.g., FWS ECOSphere number, ECO Section 7 consultation number):\n\nFWS Permit number: \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nFWS ECOSphere Section 7 consultation number: \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nIPaC report number: \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nNMFS Permit number: \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nNMFS ECO Section 7 consultation number: \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nC5.

Check to confirm that correspondence with FWS and/or NMFS and a copy of the Section 10 permit or the permit number and other relevant tracking number(s) (e.g., FWS IPaC number, ECO Section 7 consultation number) is attached to your NOI. **Check all that apply.**\n\nFWS  NMFS\n\n**If you can confirm the statement above and provide responses to C1-C6 above, you may certify eligibility under Criterion C for this pest management area on your NOI form and include your responses to C1-C6 as the supporting documentation. You are done with this worksheet. If you received a waiver to file a paper NOI, you must submit a copy of the map and list generated through the geospatial mapping tool in Step 1 and your worksheet with your paper NOI.**\n\n**If you are unable to provide answers to questions C1-C6 above, you are not eligible under Criterion C, proceed below to Criterion D.**\n\n##### ESA Eligibility Criterion D Requirements\n\nYou are eligible under Criterion D if a prior consultation under ESA Section 7(a)(2) fully covers the direct and indirect effects of your proposed discharges to waters of the United States and\n\n{166}------------------------------------------------\n\ndischarge-related activities, and the consultation resulted in written concurrence(s) by FWS and/or NMFS that the activities were not likely to adversely affect listed species or designated critical habitat under the jurisdiction of either Service, or concluded in a biological opinion from either or both Services, as necessary, that the activities were not likely to jeopardize listed species or destroy or adversely modify designated critical habitat, either as part of your activities as planned or as modified with a reasonable and prudent alternative(s). The consultation(s) must analyze all FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern identified in the Project Action Area (based on resource list generated in Step 1 within 90 days of NOI submittal).

You may select Criterion F if you self-certified and demonstrated that your discharges to waters of the United States and discharge-related activities are not likely to result in any short- or long-term adverse effects to any FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern. You must demonstrate and document this finding for each\n\n{170}------------------------------------------------\n\nindividual listed species or designated critical habitat under the jurisdiction of each Service, as appropriate. You must take appropriate measures, as needed, to avoid or eliminate the likelihood of any short- or long-term adverse effects. For example, you may rely on the specific BMPs to be applied, visual monitoring, equipment and/or site inspections, and other appropriate measures if they would be sufficient to avoid adverse effects. These measures may also include avoiding certain areas, applying pesticides to waters at concentrations below those found to cause adverse effects, or conducting applications only during seasons when FWS Listed Resources of Concern and NMFS Listed Resources of Concern are not likely to occur in areas to be exposed. These measures must be identified prior to NOI submission, described in the NOI, and implemented to receive coverage under the PGP.\n\n**In order to be eligible for coverage under Criterion F, you must confirm that the following statement is true for species under the jurisdiction of each Service, as applicable:**\n\nI have confirmed there are FWS Listed Resources of Concern and/or NMFS Listed Resources of Concern **affected directly or indirectly** in my Project Action Area.
