Analyze this document header hierarchy and identify any headers at the WRONG level.

HEADERS:
{% for level, name in headers %}
{{ level }}: {{ name }}
{% endfor %}

RULES:
1. Headers with patterns like "A.", "B.", "C.", "D." should be at the SAME level
2. Roman numerals like "I.", "II.", "III." should be at the same level
3. Only suggest fixes when you are CERTAIN - be conservative

First, describe what patterns you observe and any issues you identify.
Then provide your corrections (empty list if none needed).
